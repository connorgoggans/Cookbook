\chapter{Preface}
This is a book of recipes that I have collected from many sources and adapted to suit the equipment I own, the techniques I am comfortable with, the ingredients that are available where I live, and, most importantly, my own taste.  Some of these recipes are from cookbooks, some are from magazines and newspapers, some are from TV shows, and some are from family and friends. Many of the recently included recipes are from web sites such as The New York Times Cooking site. In many cases I don't know or have forgotten the origin of the recipes. Where I know the source of a recipe I have included it. A very few of these recipes are actually my creations, mostly, these are my recipes only in the sense that I like them and make them regularly enough so that I wanted to record them in a single place.  A few of the recipes are given exactly as I found them, but most of the recipes are changed in some way. These changes could be to the ingredients or proportions or cooking times or techniques used.  Most commonly I have changed the instructions to make them more specific and/or to make the result more pleasing to me. 

Mainly this is a place for me to record my cooking notes so they don't get lost. If you find it useful too, so much the better.

\chapter{Salads}
\recipe{Romaine, Orange, and Pecan Salad}
\label{RomaineOrangePecanSalad}


\ingredients{2 romaine lettuce hearts;
3 tablespoon olive oil;
\half cup whole pecans;
4 oranges peeled and cut into rings or 2 grapefruits cut into supremes;
1 small red onion sliced thin and separated into rings;
\half cup olive oil;
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar;
1 tablespoon lemon juice;
2 teaspoon Dijon mustard;
\half teaspoon sherry;
salt and pepper to taste.}



Prepare the lettuce by separating and washing the leaves.  Place the wet leaves on a clean towel and then roll up the towel and place it in the refrigerator to allow the leaves to become firm and crisp.  When the lettuce is crisp (after 30 minutes or so in the refrigerator), remove the large end of the center stems, if any, and then tear the leaves into bite size pieces.  Do not use the removed stems in the salad.

Saut\'{e} the pecans in olive oil until they are medium brown and then cool on absorbent paper.
  
Prepare the orange slices or grapefruit supremes. Remove the seeds from the orange slices if using. Peel the onion and slice into very thin rings.  Slicing the onion can be done with patience and a very sharp knife but is easier to accomplish using a mandolin. 

The remaining ingredients are mixed together to make the vinaigrette dressing. Fresh herbs such as dill, tarragon, basil, thyme and oregano can be added to the vinaigrette as desired.  If using, pick one of the above and add 1\half teaspoons to the dressing.  When the dressing is ready toss it with the prepared lettuce.

Arrange the salad on individual salad plates or in a single large bowl as desired by first placing the dressed romaine and then topping the romaine with the orange slices or grapefruit supremes, red onion rings, and saut\'{e}ed pecans.



Yields: Six servings.

\recipe{Hattie B's Black-Eyed Pea Salad}
\label{BlackEyedPeaSalad}

\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Pepper Vinaigrette --}
\quarter cup champagne vinegar;
\quarter cup malt vinegar;
\half cup extra virgin olive oil;
\half teaspoon minced fresh thyme;
\half teaspoon finely chopped fresh parsley;
1\half teaspoons black pepper, freshly ground;
\half teaspoon fine sea salt;
1 red bell pepper, diced small;
1 green bell pepper, diced small;
1 yellow bell pepper, diced small;
2 scallions, finely sliced;
\half teaspoon freshly roasted garlic, minced.\\
\\
\textsc{Black-Eyed Peas --}
2 cups dried black-eyed peas;
4 strips of bacon;
6 cups of chicken stock;
\half teaspoon fine sea salt.
}

Start by making the vinaigrette. Whisk together the vinegars, olive oil, thyme, parsley, black pepper, half the salt, all the peppers, scallions, and garlic.  Let sit in the refrigerator overnight.

In a large pot, add enough water to cover the peas by about 3-4 inches. Let sit overnight while the peppers are marinating. 

The next day, drain the peas in a colander and set aside.  In a large pot over medium-high heat, render the bacon, leaving it whole so it can be easily removed at the end of the recipe.  Once the bacon is rendered, add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.

Once simmering, add the peas and cook on low for about 25 minutes. The peas should be tender but not mushy.  Strain the peas,  remove the strips of bacon, and place in a stainless steel or glass mixing bowl.

While the peas are hot, toss in the vinaigrette and add \half teaspoon of salt.  Taste and adjust seasonings.

Chill completely before serving.

\recipe{Poppy-Seed Dressing}
\label{PoppySeedDressing}

\ingredients{1\half cups sugar;
    2 teaspoons dry mustard;
    2 teaspoons salt;
    \twothirds cup vinegar;
    3 tablespoons onion juice (see note after recipe);
    2 cups canola oil;
    3 tablespoons poppy seeds.}

Make the onion juice by grating a large white onion using the fine grating disk on a food processor. Use a fine mesh strainer over a bowl to strain the juice.  Press on the grated onion to extract the maximum amount of juice.   

In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade, mix sugar, mustard, salt, and vinegar. Add onion juice and pulse to stir it in thoroughly. With the machine running add oil slowly until all the oil is incorporated and a thick emulsion is formed.  Add poppy seeds and pulse to stir them in thoroughly. Store in a cool place, or in the refrigerator. Makes 3-1/2 cups.

The dressing is delicious on fruit salads of any kind.

\recipe{Greens}

\ingredients{3 bunches mustard greens;
4 bunches turnip greens;
2 cups water;
\half pound salt pork;
\half stick of butter or 2 tablespoons of rendered bacon fat;
salt and black pepper to taste.}

Cut the salt pork into batons.  Add pork to water in the stock pot set over high heat.  When water comes to a boil reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes or so.

While the pork stock is simmering, prepare the greens for cooking by removing crushed or yellow leaves and cutting off excess stems with the roots.  Wash greens thoroughly in plenty of cold water. Lift leaves from container of water and let sand and grit settle to bottom. Wash through several changes of water until greens are completely clean.

Bring pork stock to a boil then add the greens and stir.  When the greens are wilted, reduce heat and simmer until tender. When tender check the amount of liquid. Pour off and save all but around a cup of liquid.  Add butter or bacon fat and stir.

\recipe{Brooklyn-Style Collard Greens}

\label{BrooklynCollards}


\ingredients{1 smoked turkey wing or 2 medium ham hocks;
3 to 4 bunches collard greens (about four pounds)
salt;
\quarter cup apple cider vinegar;
3 garlic cloves, smashed;
\quarter teaspoon sugar;
1 medium onion, sliced;
\half teaspoon crushed red pepper, more to taste.}

Place turkey wing or hocks in a very large pot and add just 
enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, turn heat to medium 
and simmer until water is reduced by about half.

Meanwhile, plunge greens into a sink full of lightly salted cold water, 
drain and then rinse well with cold fresh water. Trim or remove biggest stems. 
Place five or six leaves on top of one another and roll like a cigar, lengthwise. 
Cut collards into inch-wide ribbons, then, keeping collards rolled,
cut ribbons in half.

Turn heat under pot to high. Add vinegar, one teaspoon salt and the garlic,
then add as many greens as pot will hold. Wait until greens cook down, 
then add remaining greens. Turn heat to a simmer, cover and cook until greens
 for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add sugar, onion and crushed red pepper, cover again and continue 
to simmer until tender, another 15 to 30 minutes; 
time will vary depending on toughness of greens. Serve.

\recipe{White Beans with Collards}

\ingredients{1 pound large navy beans (washed and picked over for stones);
2 quarts water;
1 large onion chopped;
1 small (grocery store) bunch of collard greens;
1 pound smoked ham (cubed);
3 cloves garlic (chopped);
1 tablespoon table salt;
1 tablespoon white pepper;
1 whole red pepper;
\half cup olive oil;
1 bay leave.}

Placed washed beans, water, and chopped onion in a large Dutch oven
or small stock pot (at least 6 qts.). Bring beans to boil and then boil for 1 hour.

Remove the stems from the greens using a sharp knife to cut the
green portion of the leaves from both sides of the stem.  Wash the green
portions of the leaves very well to remove all sand and dirt (this may
require moving the leaves back an forth between sinks of clean water).
Take two or three leaf halves and roll into a cigar shape (roll from front
to back of leave). Cut the roll in half along the axis and then perpendicular
to the axis in one inch intervals.

When beans have cooked for 1 hour, add greens to beans along with ham,
garlic, salt, white pepper, and whole red pepper. Stir well, adding olive oil
and bay leave.

Cover pot and let simmer for 30 minutes until both greens and beans are tender.

Source: Leah Chase from The Dooky Chase Cookbook

Notes: In place of the whole red pepper I used a chopped red bell pepper
and added a few teaspoons of very hot hot-sauce. I also added around
3 tablespoons of cider vinegar because I decided it was needed to balance
the richness of the olive oil.  I used smoked ham but I think the dish would be
even better with the ham replaced with smoked pork shoulder.

\recipe{Braised Collards With Peanut Butter and Hot Honey on Corn Bread}

\ingredients{
2 tablespoons neutral oil;
2  yellow onions, finely diced;
2 mild red chili peppers, sliced in rings;
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced;
2 tablespoons tomato paste;
2 tablespoons apple  cider vinegar;
2 pounds (around 2 bunches) collard greens, thoroughly washed, stems removed, cut into 2-inch pieces;
3 cups water;
\half cup peanut butter;
1 recipe of \hyperref[cornbread]{corn bread} made in four small skillets; 2 tablespoons Frank's RedHot Sauce;
2 tablespoons honey; \half cup roasted peanuts; kosher salt;
black pepper, freshly ground.}

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions pick up some color, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat and continue cooking until the onions are totally soft, about 20 minutes.

Add the sliced chili and cook for a couple of minutes to soften. Add the garlic and cook a few minutes more until it starts to soften. Stir in the tomato paste, coating the vegetables with it, and cook until it darkens a few shades, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cider vinegar and use it to help scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pot.

Add the collards, a handful at a time, wilting them between additions. Pour 2 cups of water into the pot, season with a pinch of salt, cover, and simmer the greens for 10 minutes.

Uncover the pot and stir. Add the peanut butter and swirl until it dissolves into the pot liquor. Add the remaining 1 cup of water to the pot, cover, and simmer the greens until they are tinder, about 30 minutes longer. Season with salt, if needed, and pepper. At this point the collards can be cooled and refrigerated up to 3 days.

When ready to serve, reheat the collards and make one recipe of \hyperref[cornbread]{corn bread} in four small cast-iron skillets. While the corn bread is in the oven, make the hot honey by stirring the hot sauce and honey in a small bowl until smooth. Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper then reserve for serving.

When the cornbread comes out of the oven it is time to assemble the dish. Place a cornbread round each in the bottom of four large shallow bowls. Spoon the collards and juices over the cornbread and drizzle with the hot honey. Sprinkle with peanuts and serve.

\recipe{Zucchini Pancakes (Mucver)}

\ingredients{3 medium zucchini (about 1 pound), shredded;
Salt;
freshly ground black pepper;
3 large eggs, beaten;
\half cup all-purpose flour;
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil;
1 cup crumbled feta cheese;
3 scallions, finely chopped;
\third cup finely chopped dill;
1 teaspoon baking powder;
4 to 6 tablespoons vegetable oil, more as needed;
\twothirds cup plain yogurt;
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped;
\half teaspoon salt.}

Preheat oven to 250\deg F. Place zucchini in a colander over a bowl, and mix with \half teaspoon salt. Allow to drain for five minutes. Transfer to a cloth kitchen towel, and squeeze hard to extract as much moisture as possible. Squeeze a second time; volume will shrink to about half the original.

In a large mixing bowl, combine zucchini and eggs. Using a fork, mix well. Add flour, \half teaspoon salt, olive oil, feta, scallions, dill and \half teaspoon black pepper. Mix well, add baking powder, and mix again.

Place a cast iron skillet or other heavy skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat until shimmering. Place heaping tablespoons of zucchini batter in pan several inches apart, allowing room to spread. Flatten them with a spatula if necessary; pancakes should be about \threeeights inch thick and about 3 inches in diameter. Fry until golden on one side, then turn and fry again until golden on other side. Repeat once or twice, frying about 5 to 6 minutes total, so pancakes get quite crisp. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and keep warm in oven. Continue frying remaining batter, adding more oil to pan as needed. Serve hot.

For yogurt sauce: In a small bowl, combine yogurt, garlic and salt. Mix well, and serve on the side or on pancakes.

\recipe{Butter Bean and Ham Soup}
\label{ButterBeanAndHamSoup}
\equilpment{10-quart stock pot; 8-quart pot or food-container;  immersion blender.}

\ingredients{1 ham bone from Honey Baked Ham; 4 quarts water; 2 pounds Camellia Brand dried large limas; 2 large yellow or white onions, chopped; 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped; 2 bay leaves; 1 tablespoon \hyperref[CreoleSeasoning]{Creole seasoning}; olive oil; salt and black pepper to taste.
}


\textsc{This recipe works best if the ham stock is made the day before the soup and allowed to cool overnight in the refrigerator.}

Cut most of the ham off of the ham bone and reserve.  Place the ham bone in the stock pot and add the water.  Bring to a boil and then simmer covered for 1 to 2 hours until the bone separates into two pieces and the attached ham falls off the bone. Remove pot from heat and fish out the bones.  Place the pot in the refrigerator overnight to cool.

In the morning skim off the congealed fat from the top of the ham stock. Strain the stock into  the food-container. Dump out the strainer onto a large cutting board then pick out the ham from the fat and gristle. Shred the ham and add it to the food-container.  

Add olive oil to cleaned stock pot and place over medium heat.  When oil is hot add onions and garlic with a good pinch of salt. Cook stirring occasionally until the onions are lightly browned. While the onions are cooking dice the reserved ham into \quarter inch cubes.  Add olive oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet and use to brown the ham cubes. Add the ham stock and ham cubes to the onions. Sort and rinse the beans and add to the stock along with the bay leaves and Creole seasoning. Bring pot to a boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for about 1\half hours until the beans are tender. 

With a ladle, remove some beans and liquid and place in the container that came with the immersion blender.  Pur\'{e}e with the immersion blender until smooth and then add back to pot. Stir to combine and evaluate the thickness.  Continue to pur\'{e}e beans until the desired thickness is achieved. Season the soup to taste with salt and black pepper.

\recipe{Vegetable Broth Base}
\label{VegetableBroth}

\ingredients{2 leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped and washed thoroughly (2\half cups or 5 ounces);
2 carrots, peeled and cut into \half-inch pieces (\twothirds cup or 3 ounces);
\half small celery root, peeled and cut into \half-inch pieces (\threequarters cup or 3 ounces);
\half cup (\half ounce) parsley leaves and thin stems;
3 tablespoons dried minced onions;
2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt;
1\half tablespoons tomato paste;
3 tablespoons soy sauce.}

For the best balance of flavors, measure the prepped vegetables by weight. Kosher salt aids in grinding the vegetables. The broth base contains enough salt to keep it from freezing solid, making it easy to remove 1 tablespoon at a time. To make 1 cup of broth, stir 1 tablespoon of fresh or frozen broth base into 1 cup of boiling water. If particle-free broth is desired, let the broth steep for 5 minutes and then strain it through a fine-mesh strainer.

Process leeks, carrots, celery root, parsley, minced onions, and salt in food processor, scraping down sides of bowl frequently, until paste is as fine as possible, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato paste and process for 1 minute, scraping down sides of bowl every 20 seconds. Add soy sauce and continue to process 1 minute longer. Transfer mixture to airtight container and tap firmly on counter to remove air bubbles. Press small piece of parchment paper flush against surface of mixture and cover. Freeze for up to 6 months.

To make broth for use, mix 1 tablespoon of base for each cup of boiling water. For example, to make a quart of stock mix 4 tablespoons of base with 1 quart of boiling water.  To make 7 quarts of broth, mix an entire recipe of base with 7 quarts of boiling water.

\recipe{Smoked Pulled Pork, Collard Greens, and Blackeye Peas Gumbo}

\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Roux --}
\twothirds cup vegetable oil or bacon fat;
\threequarters cup flour;
2 medium onions, diced;
1 medium green bell pepper, diced;
1 rib celery, diced;
3 cloves garlic, minced;
8 cups chicken stock, 1 cup reserved.\\
\\
\textsc{Gumbo --}
2 bay leaves;
3 slices hardwood smoked bacon;
1 bunch collard greens, washed and sliced into ribbons;
1 white onion, chopped;
1 teaspoon white vinegar;
2 teaspoons sugar;
2 teaspoons Louisiana-style hot sauce;
2 teaspoons salt;
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper;
2 cups cooked blackeye peas prepared from fresh, frozen or dryed blackeye peas;
1 pounds smoked, pulled pork (not with barbecue sauce), shredded;
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme;
1 tablespoon \hyperref[CreoleSeasoning]{Creole seasoning}.}

Cook blackeyed peas and then hold drained peas in the refrigerator. Dice vegetables and mince garlic for the roux.

In an 8 cup glass measuring cup combine the flour and the oil or bacon fat.  Make a very \hyperref[BrownRoux]{dark roux} using the microwave oven. When roux is a deep chocolate color, add the celery, onions, bell pepper, and garlic to the measuring cup and and saut\'{e} in the roux until tender, around 5 minutes. The roux will continue to darken, and the vegetables will caramelize.
 

Transfer roux to a large cast-iron Dutch oven. Add 7 cups of stock and bay leaves to the roux mixture. Simmer for an hour, stirring often. Skim any fat off the top. The roux mixture will seem very thin at this point but this is necessary to account for the  large amount of ingredients added in the next steps.

While stock is simmering, fry bacon in a tall sided skillet or shallow Dutch oven until crisp. Remove bacon and drain on paper towels, leaving bacon drippings in skillet or oven.

Wash collard greens in several changes of water to remove all grit than remove stems and slice leaves into ribbons.  Chop remaining onion then add collard greens and chopped onion to bacon drippings in skillet, and saut\'{e} until wilted. Crumble bacon and combine it with cooked greens/onion mixture.

After the roux mixture has simmered for an hour, to Dutch oven, add vinegar, sugar, hot sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Then add greens mixture, blackeye peas, pork, thyme, and Creole seasoning. If the gumbo is too thick then add some of the reserved stock.

Return to a simmer and adjust seasonings to taste.

Serve over hot cooked rice with French bread.

Yield:  10 servings.

\recipe{Duck and Andouille Gumbo}

\ingredients{2 frozen ducks, thawed;
2 pounds andouille sausage cut into 1/4 inch rounds;
2 medium onions, finely chopped;
1 bell pepper, finely chopped;
4 stalks celery, finely chopped;
1 cup canola oil;
1 cup flour;
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped;
3 bay leaves;
\quarter teaspoon ground allspice;
\quarter teaspoon cayenne pepper;
1 teaspoon basil;
\half teaspoon powdered cloves;
\half teaspoon poultry seasoning;
1 tablespoon salt;
1 teaspoon ground black pepper;
4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce;
\half teaspoon Tabasco sauce;
4 (10\half ounce) cans of Campbells beef consomm\'e;
3 consomm\'e cans of water.} 


Prepare duck by pricking skin all over and then cooking in a glass tabletop convection oven.  Brown ducks one at a time. Start with the oven at 300 \deg F for 30 minutes to render the fat under the skin and then increase to 450 \deg F and cook until browned. Let both ducks cool and then remove meat from the bones and reserve.
Be sure to save the rendered duck fat for another use or, if you live dangerously, to make the roux. This step can be done well in advance.

Prepare the sausage, onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic.

Combine the consomm\'e and water in a stockpot and bring to boil. Reduce heat and let simmer.

In a heavy skillet brown the sausage then drain on paper towels.

In an 8 cup glass measuring cup combine the flour and the oil and/or duck fat.  Make a very \hyperref[BrownRoux]{dark roux} using the microwave oven. When roux is ready cook the celery, onions, and pepper in the roux until it is tender. Transfer roux to a large cast-iron Dutch oven. Very carefully add hot stock to the roux stirring vigorously until roux is smooth and thin.

Add duck, sausage, roux and all remaining ingredients except for the pepper sauce and green onions. Partially cover and continue simmering until duck is very tender around 2\half hours.

Remove from heat and add pepper sauce.  Taste for seasoning and add salt if needed.  Stir in green onions and serve over rice.

\recipe{Leftover-Turkey Gumbo}
\label{TurkeyGumbo}
\ingredients{Leftover turkey carcass with enough leg and thigh meat to make 3 to 4 cups cubed -- a smoked turkey is best.\\
\\
\textsc{Turkey Bone Broth --}
3 ribs celery, roughly chopped;
2 medium onions, roughly chopped; 
4 garlic cloves, smashed; 
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns;
1 tablespoon thyme leaves;
4 bay leaves;
1 gallon water.\\
\\
\textsc{Gumbo --}
\threequarters cup vegetable oil;
\threequarters cup all-purpose flour;
2 cups chopped onions
\half cup chopped red bell peppers;
\half cup chopped celery;
1 tablespoon minced garlic;
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped fine;
3 quarts turkey bone broth;
3 tablespoons or so Kitchen Bouquet, optional;
4 cups turkey meat, torn into bite-sized pieces from the turkey carcass and/or leftovers;
\half pound andouille, cut into \quarter inch rounds then quartered;
salt; freshly ground pepper; ground cayenne; hot sauce; flat-leaf parsley, chopped;
green onions, thinly sliced.
}

Remove as much meat as possible from the turkey carcass; tear into bite-sized pieces. Refrigerate the meat until you are ready to make the gumbo.

To make the turkey bone broth, break up carcass and place pieces on a foil-lined half sheet-pan. Roast at 425 \deg F until bones are browned.

Place the browned carcass pieces in a large stockpot. Scrape all the browned bits and fond from the sheet-pan and add to pot. Add the celery, onions, garlic, thyme, peppercorns and bay leaves. Add one gallon of water.  Add more water if necessary to cover carcass pieces. 

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat so that the broth is at a bare simmer. Cook for at least 2 hours and up to overnight. If simmering for an extended time, partially or fully cover the pot. 

Strain the broth through a large colander and discard the solids. Refrigerate until the fat has solidified and can be easily removed. Should yield 3 quarts of stock.  The gumbo uses 1\half to 2 quarts of stock. The extra stock can be frozen and used for another purpose (\hyperref[TurkeyGravy]{turkey gravy}).

To make the gumbo, chop and have ready the onions, peppers, celery and garlic. While preparing the vegetables, heat 2 quarts of bone broth in a large saucepan. 

In a heavy skillet brown the sausage then drain on paper towels. When the sausage has cooled, cut the rounds into quarters.

In an 8 cup glass measuring cup combine the flour and the oil.  Using the recipe given elsewhere in these notes, make a very \hyperref[BrownRoux]{dark roux} using the microwave oven. When roux is a deep chocolate color, add the celery, onions, bell pepper, garlic and thyme to the measuring cup, stir until blended, and cook in the roux until the onion is tender (2 minutes + 1 minute + 1 minute + 1 minute). If any oil as risen to the top, pour this off.

Transfer roux to a large cast-iron Dutch oven. Very carefully add 6 cups of the hot broth to the roux stirring vigorously until roux is smooth and thin. Add Kitchen Bouquet to achieve desired color. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes. Add the reserved turkey meat and sausage to the gumbo.  If the gumbo is too thick then add up to 2 additional cups of hot stock to thin it. Simmer for 20 minutes.

Season to taste with salt, pepper and cayenne; let simmer another 10 minutes. Check the seasoning and adjust if needed.

Place a mound of cooked rice in each soup bowl, surround with the gumbo, and sprinkle with parsley and green onions.

\recipe{Brown Roux}
\label{BrownRoux}

\ingredients{flour; canola oil or well rendered bacon fat; onions, chopped; bell peppers, chopped; celery, chopped; garlic, minced; Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce (optional).}

\textsc{I leaned to make roux in a microwave oven from the book Tout de Suite \`{a} la Microwave by Jean K. Durkee. In 1977 when this book was published the maximum output power of home microwave ovens was 600 - 650 watts. The output power of current microwave ovens is 1000 - 1200 watts with 1000 watts being the most common value. The instructions here are for a 1000 watt oven, however, ovens vary enough that you will have to play with the cook times in this recipe and find values that work with your oven.}

Combine equal amounts  of flour and oil or fat in an 8 cup Pyrex measuring cup (typically \twothirds cup of each or use the amounts specified in your recipe). Stir well to combine with a sturdy metal whisk or a long handled wooden spoon.

Microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Carefully remove measuring cup from microwave using a dish towel and stir well being very careful not to splatter any of the hot roux on yourself (it's called Cajun napalm for a reason). The roux should be light brown at this point. Return measuring cup to the microwave and cook on high for 2 minutes then remove again and stir. Return measuring cup to the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute then remove again and stir. Continue this process of cooking for 1 minute and stirring until roux is the desired color. Three or four 1 minute cooking intervals is usually enough to get a dark brown roux. If a very dark roux is desired it may be necessary to reduce the cooking interval to 30 seconds when the roux is dark but not dark enough to avoid burning the roux. 

If you burn your roux as evidenced by black specks and smoke then toss it out and start over.  Since a roux can be made so quickly in the microwave you haven't lost much time.  After a some experimentation and practice with your microwave you will be able to turn out perfectly dark roux every time.

Once the flour and fat mixture is browned to your satisfaction you can proceed to cook the onions, bell peppers, celery and garlic specified in your recipe in the microwave by adding them to the measuring cup or you can proceed as described below.

Transfer roux to a large cast iron Dutch oven and add the onions, bell peppers, celery, and garlic in the amounts specified in your recipe. Saut\'{e} vegetables for around 5 minutes. The roux will continue to darken and the vegetables will caramelize. If any oil has risen to the top, pour this off.

Add stock to roux mixture and stir well.  It the color is not dark enough to suit you then add a tablespoon or more of Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce to achieve the desired color. Professional kitchens add caramelized sugar to color their roux so this is not cheating. If they can do it then you can too. Kitchen Bouquet is made with caramel and caramelized vegetables so it is actually a better way to add color since it adds flavor too.

\recipe{Red Curry Lentils With Sweet Potatoes and Spinach}
\label{RedCurryLentils}

\ingredients{3 tablespoons olive oil;
1 pound sweet potatoes (about 2 medium sweet potatoes), peeled and cut into \threequarters inch cubes;
1 medium yellow onion, chopped;
3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste;

\half lime, juiced;
Fresh cilantro leaves, for serving;
Toasted unsweetened coconut flakes, for serving (optional).}

In a Dutch oven or pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium- high. Add the sweet potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the browned sweet potatoes to a plate and set aside.

Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot and set the heat to medium-low. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the curry paste, garlic, ginger, chile and turmeric, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the lentils, stock, salt and browned sweet potatoes to the pot and bring to a boil over high. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Add the coconut milk and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and the lentils are creamy and falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the spinach and stir until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the lime juice and season with salt to taste.

Divide among shallow bowls and top with cilantro and coconut flakes, if using.

I like to serve these shrimp on top of yellow rice.  I strain some of the capers and onions from the marinade and reserve a little liquid from the marinade before adding the raw shrimp.  I add the reserved onions, capers, and marinade liquid to the yellow rice.  This recipe is ideal for entertaining because it requires very little last minute preparation.

\\
\textsc{Fish Fingers --} 10 to 12 ounces cod or keta salmon fillets, pin bones and skin removed; \half cup panko breadcrumbs; \half cup shredded unsweetened coconut; 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water; all-purpose flour, salt and pepper, neutral oil for pan frying.
}

For dipping sauce, in a small sauce pan over medium-high heat, combine apricot preserves,  vinegar, ginger, and \quarter cup of water. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to low and simmer until slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the scallion and sambal then season with salt to taste. Transfer the sauce to a small serving bowl and reserve.

For the fish fingers, begin by patting the fish dry with paper towels and cutting it into 1-inch wide strips. Sprinkle the fish with salt and let it sit for a few minutes while you prepare the coating.

Chose three shallow bowls and set up a three bowl dredging system. Put flour in the first bowl and egg/water mixture in the second bowl. In the third bowl, combine the panko and coconut and then season the mixture with salt and pepper.

Rinse the fish fingers to remove the excess salt and then dry them well with paper towels. One at a time, coat the fish in flour, tapping off any excess, then dip in the egg wash. Finally, add the fish to the panko mixture and turn to coat the finger, pressing down so that the coating adheres to the fish.  Place the coated fish finger on a plate and then repeat the coating process with the remaining fish.

Add \half inch of oil to a medium skillet and place on medium-high heat.  When the oil reaches 400\deg F, add the fish fingers (in batches if necessary) and fry, turning once or twice until golden.  This should take 2 or 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle lightly with salt.

Transfer fried fish to a platter and serve immediately accompanied with the dipping sauce.

\recipe{Catfish Pecan with Lemon Thyme Butter}


\ingredients{3 cups (10 ounces) pecan halves;
1\half cups all-purpose flour;
Creole seafood seasoning, to taste;
1 medium egg;
1 cup milk;
6 catfish fillets, 5 to 7 ounces each;
12 tablespoons (1\half sticks) butter;
3 lemons, cut in half;
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce;
6 large sprigs fresh thyme;
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.}

Place half the pecans, the flour, and the Creole
seasoning in the work bowl of a food processor, and process until
finely ground. Transfer the pecan flour to a large bowl.

Whisk the egg in a large mixing bowl and add the milk. Season both
sides of the fish fillets with Creole seasoning. On e at a time,
place the fillets in the egg wash.

Remove one fillet from the egg wash, letting any excess fluid
drain back into the bowl. Dredge the fillet in the pecan flour and
coat both sides, shaking off any excess. Transfer to a dry sheet
pan, and repeat with the remaining fillets.

Place a large saut\'e an over high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the
butter. Heat for about 2 minute, or until the butter is completely
melted and starts to bubble. Place three fish fillets in the pan,
skin side up, and cook for 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to medium,
and cook for another 1\threequarters to 2 minutes, or until the fillets are
evenly brown and crisp. Turn the fish over and cook on the second
side for 2 to 2\half minutes, or until the fish is firm to the
touch and an even brown. The most important factor in determining
the ideal cooking time is the thickness of the fillets you are
using.

Remove the fish, place on a baking rack, wipe the pan clean with a
paper towel, and 2 tablespoons of butter, and repeat with the
remaining pieces of fish.

When a all the fish fillets are cooked, wipe the pan, and return

\recipe{Shrimp in Cashew-Yogurt Sauce}
\ingredients{1 to 1\quarter pounds large (16-20 count) frozen shrimp, shell-on and deveined;
5 tablespoons unsalted butter;
1 medium onion;
2 cloves garlic;
\half teaspoon chili powder, plus more as needed;
\half teaspoon ground cumin;
1 teaspoon ground turmeric;
\half teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed;
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; 
1 cup roasted, unsalted cashews;
2 cups plain Greek yogurt, preferably full-fat}

Place the shrimp (to taste) in a bowl of tap water and let them defrost a bit while you prep the butter. When you can, pull off the tails and reserve.

Melt the butter in the pot, over medium-low heat. As soon as white milk solids form on the surface, skim off and discard them. The butter should be mostly golden and clear; you have clarified it enough for this dish.

Add the reserved shrimp tails; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. (You are infusing the butter with shrimp flavor!)

Meanwhile, peel the shrimp; it's okay if they are not fully defrosted. Cut the onion into small dice. Mince the garlic.

Remove the shrimp tails from the pot and discard, then stir in the onion and garlic. Increase the heat to medium; cook for 3 or 4 minutes until just softened, stirring a few times, then add the chili powder, cumin, turmeric, salt and pepper, stirring to incorporate. Add half the cashews.

Add the yogurt, stirring to form a thick sauce; cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low.
 
Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture right in the pot.

Drain the shrimp and add them to the pot, along with the remaining cashews. Increase the heat to medium; cook for about 4 minutes, stirring to make sure all the shrimp is pink and no longer translucent. Taste and add more salt and/or chili powder, as needed.

Divide among wide, shallow bowls. Sprinkle each portion with a little chili powder, and serve warm.

Makes four servings when served over rice. Attractive when topped with strips of roasted red bell pepper.

\recipe{Salmon Burgers}

\ingredients{1\quarter pounds (20 ounces) skinless center-cut salmon fillet, pin bones removed;
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard;
1 tablespoon \hyperref[MyMayonnaise]{mayonnaise};
1 tablespoon lemon juice;
\half teaspoon grated lemon zest;
pinch of cayenne pepper;
2 scallions, chopped;
2 tablespoons plus 2 cups (or more) Panko  breadcrumbs;
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper;
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing;
4 brioche buns, split;
\hyperref[TartarSauce]{Tartar sauce} and arugula, for topping.}

Cut three-quarters (15 ounces) of the salmon into \quarter inch pieces. Put in a large
bowl. Cut the remaining 5 ounces of the salmon into chunk. Transfer the chunks to a food processor along with the mustard, mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest and cayenne. Pulse to make a paste. Add the pureed salmon mixture to the bowl with the diced salmon. Add the scallions, 2 tablespoons Panko, \half teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Gently mix until just combined.

Line a quarter sheet pan with parchment paper or oiled foil.
Weigh the salmon mixture and divide it into 4 equal weight mounds on the sheet pan. Using a 4-inch diameter ring-mold form the mounds into patties.  Loosely cover the sheet pan with plastic wrap and then refrigerate the patties for at least 30 minutes.

Spread the remaining 2 cups Panko on a plate. Press both sides of the salmon patties in the Panko. Use more Panko if necessary to cover evenly cover both sides of all the patties. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the patties (in batches if necessary) and cook until browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary. Turn and cook until the other side is browned and the patties feel springy in the center, 3 to 4 more minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; season with salt.

Meanwhile, arrange the buns, cut-side up, on a broiler pan and broil
until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. This works best in a toaster oven.

Place the patties on the buns topped with tartar sauce and arugula. Serve with a hearty salad like \hyperref[BrownwoodColeslaw]{Brownwood-Style Coleslaw}, \hyperref[BlackEyedPeaSalad]{Hattie B's Black-Eyed Pea Salad} or \hyperref[CurriedCarrotRaisinSalad]{Curried Carrot Raisin Salad}.

Yield: Four large burgers -- enough to serve 4 for dinner.  The same amount of salmon mixture can be made into 6 burgers if smaller serving are desired.

\recipe{Marinated Game Hens in Mustard and Tarragon Sauce}

\ingredients{4 game hens;
\half cup olive oil;
\half teaspoon dried or 1\half teaspoons fresh tarragon;
2 tablespoons chopped shallot;
2 tablespoons chopped shallot
\half cup white wine or tarragon vinegar;
\half cup white vermouth;
2 tablespoons lemon or lime; 
juice strained roasting pan juices;
2 cups chicken stock;
1 cup heavy cream;
1 tablespoons Dijon mustard;
\half teaspoon tarragon or to taste;
3 or 4 tablespoons butter.}

Spilt the game hens with poultry shears (removing the backbone) and marinate overnight in a mixture of olive oil, tarragon, and shallot.

Arrange the split hens meat side up in a deep roasting pan.  Be sure that the hens do not touch.  Roast the hens for 35 to 45 minutes in a 375\deg F oven.  Check the drum sticks for doneness.

Transfer the hens to a covered warming pan and keep warm in the oven.  Strain the juice from the cooking pan and reserve for use in the sauce in the next step.

The remaining ingredients and the pan juices are used to make the sauce.  Because this is a reduction sauce, all the remaining ingredients should be prepared and measured before beginning the sauce.

In a wide, non-reactive skillet placed over high heat, add the vinegar, vermouth, and chopped shallots and boil until nearly dry.

Add the lemon or lime juice and the pan juices and reduce by one half.

Add the chicken stock to the pan and reduce by one half again.

Add the cream to the sauce and cook down to the consistency of maple syrup.

Finish the sauce by adding the mustard, tarragon, and butter.

Remove the hens from the warming pan and place on the serving platter.  Surround the hens with the broccoli and carrots and drizzle the sauce over the hens.  Serve the remaining sauce in a sauce boat.

I learned to make this from my friend Rosa Rajkovic during my time in Albuquerque, NM.  The reduction sauce that accompanies the game hens is very rich.  As a result, I usually serve this with a simple garnish of steamed baby carrots and/or broccoli on the serving platter and nothing but this and bread for the main course.  I have made several variations of this recipe.  These include replacing the vermouth with red port or Madeira and replacing the white vinegar with red.  Instead of roasting the marinated game hens they can be grilled and the sauce made without the pan juices.  Serves 8 (half a game hen per person is usually enough if a meal with a vegetable garnish, salad, bread, and desert is served).

\recipe{Slow Roasted Turkey Breasts}

\ingredients{whole turkey breast with bones attached;
1 cup kosher salt;
1 cup sugar}

If the turkey breast is frozen defrost it in the refrigerator for a day or two until completely thawed. Carefully cut the two breast off the bone while leaving the skin covering the breasts intact. Reserve the bones for stock making.  The breasts should weight from 3 to 4\half pounds each.  

In a sauce pan bring 2 quarts of water to boil with the salt and sugar. Pour brine into brining container and add ice to make the total volume 4 quarts.  Submerge the turkey breast in the brine and refrigerate from 12 to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 250\deg F.  Remove the breasts from the brine and wrap each one four times in plastic wrap and once in aluminum foil. Place the breast on a wire rack in a half sheet pan.

\recipe{Roasted Spatchcocked Chicken}

\ingredients{3 to 4 pound whole chicken;
1 tablespoons kosher salt;
\half tablespoon fresh ground black pepper;
2 tablespoons pure olive oil;
2 tablespoons unsalted butter;
juice of one lemon.}

Preheat oven to 400\deg F. 

To spatchcock chicken first remove the back bone by cutting down both sides of the bone with heavy kitchen shears. Turn over chicken so that skin side is up and press hard on the breast to flatten the chicken. Although not necessary, the sternum can be removed to make the chicken very flat as this helps with the browning step. Cut off the wing tips and secure the ends of the legs by inserting them into slits cut in the skin at the bottom of the breast. 

Mix the salt and pepper together in a small bowl. Carefully dry the chicken with paper towels and then heavily season both sides with the salt and pepper mix.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. When hot add olive oil and then butter. After the butter stops foaming, add chicken to the skillet skin-side down. Let the chicken skin brown without moving the chicken for approximately 3 minutes. When the chicken is brown, carefully turn the chicken over. Avoid breaking the skin while turning the chicken. Transfer the skillet with the chicken to the oven.

Roast chicken until until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reaches 165 \deg F. Transfer chicken to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil, and let stand 10 minutes.

Add lemon juice and, optionally, an additional tablespoon butter to the pan, swirling to combine. Cut chicken into pieces and serve immediately drizzled with the pan sauce.

\recipe{Peruvian-Style Grilled Chicken}

\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Green Sauce --}
3 whole jalape\~{n}o chiles, roughly chopped;1 tablespoon  aj\'{i} amarillo pepper paste; 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves (28g); 2 medium cloves garlic; \half cup  mayonnaise; \quarter cup  sour cream; 2 teaspoons fresh juice; 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar; 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil; Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper;\\
\\
\textsc{Chicken --}
1 whole chicken, 3\half to 4 pounds; 4 teaspoons  kosher salt; 2 tablespoons ground cumin; 2 tablespoons  paprika; 1 teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper; 3 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon); 2 tablespoons  white vinegar; 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil.
}

To make the sauce combine jalape\~{n}os, aj\'{i} amarillo (if using), cilantro, garlic, mayonnaise, sour cream, lime juice, and vinegar in the jar of a blender. Blend on high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until smooth. With blender running, slowly drizzle in olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Sauce will be quite loose at this point, but will thicken as it sits. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. 

To prepare the chicken, pat chicken dry with paper towels and place on a large cutting board, breast side down. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove backbone by cutting along either side of it. Turn chicken over and lay out flat. Press firmly on breast to flatten chicken. For added stability, run a metal or wooden skewer horizontally through chicken, entering through one thigh, going through both breast halves, and exiting through other thigh. Tuck wing tips behind back.

Combine salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, garlic, vinegar, and oil in a small bowl and massage with fingertips until homogeneous. Spread mixture evenly over all surfaces of chicken. 

Light a chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread coals evenly over half of coal grate. Alternatively, set half the burners of a gas grill to high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate. 

Place chicken, skin side up, on cooler side of grill, with legs facing toward hotter side. Cover grill, with vents on lid open and aligned over chicken. Open bottom vents of grill. Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 110\deg F (43\deg C). Carefully flip chicken and place, skin side down, on hotter side of grill, with breasts pointed toward cooler side. Press down firmly with a wide, stiff spatula to ensure good contact between bird and grill grates. Cover and cook until skin is crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 145 to 150\deg F (63 to 66\deg C), about 10 minutes longer. If chicken threatens to burn before temperature is achieved, carefully slide to cooler side of grill, cover, and continue to cook until done. Do not leave the lid off for longer than it takes to check temperature, or chicken will burn.

Transfer chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve with sauce.

\recipe{Beef, Turkey, and Andouille Meat Loaf}

\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Loaf --}
2 tablespoons olive oil;
1\half cups onion, finely chopped;
\half cup chopped red bell peppers;
2 teaspoons minced garlic;
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce;
2 cups fresh bread crumbs;
\half cup milk;
2 large eggs, lightly beaten;
\half pound andouille, coarsely chopped in food processor;
1 pound 85\% lean ground beef;
1 pound ground turkey;
\half teaspoon dried sage;
1 teaspoon dried thyme;
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper;
1 teaspoon salt;
\\
\\
\textsc{Glaze --}
4 tablespoons (2 ounces) Dijon mustard;
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar;
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar.}

Preheat oven to 350\deg F. In a food processor make bread crumbs from 2 or 3 slices of hearty white bread.  Empty food processor and reserve bread crumbs. Cut andouille in large chunks and place in food processor. Pulse food processor until andouille is coarsely chopped.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add onions, bell peppers, garlic and a pinch of salt. Cover and cook  stirring occasionally until soft, around 5 minutes. Remove from heat and then add sage, thyme, pepper and salt. Stir to combine.  In as small bowl combine bread crumbs, milk, and Worcestershire sauce.  Once combined add beaten eggs and stir in. 

Put on food service nitrile gloves. Place chopped andouille, ground beef and ground turkey in a large bowl.  Mix the meats by hand until roughly homogeneous. Add onion mixture and bread crumb mixture to the meat mixture and knead by hand until well blended. Line a half sheet pan with foil and spray a metal loaf pan with cooking spray. Uniformly pack the meat loaf mixture into the loaf pan to form a loaf about 10 by 4 by 4 inches.  Turn out the loaf onto the sheet pan and remove the loaf pan. It may be necessary to slam the loaf pan onto the sheet pan to dislodge the meat mixture. Place loaf in oven and bake for 30 minutes.

While the loaf is in the oven combine the mustard, brown sugar and vinegar to make a glaze. After the first 30 minutes of baking, brush the glaze all over the loaf.

Bake the loaf for 30 to 45 minutes more until the internal temperature is 155\deg F.  Let loaf rest for 10 to 20 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before slicing and serving.

\recipe{Garlic-Lime Grilled Pork Tenderloin Steaks}

\ingredients{2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed;
1 tablespoon grated lime zest plus 1/4 cup juice (2 limes);
4 garlic cloves, minced;
4 teaspoons honey;
2 teaspoons fish sauce
\threequarters teaspoon salt;
\half teaspoon pepper; 
\half cup vegetable oil;
4 teaspoons mayonnaise;
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro;
Flake sea salt (optional)}

Slice each tenderloin in half crosswise (perpendicular to the long axis) to create 4 steaks total. Pound each half to 3/4-inch thickness. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep slits spaced 1/2 inch apart in crosshatch pattern on both sides of steaks.

Whisk lime zest and juice, garlic, honey, fish sauce, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil into lime mixture until smooth and slightly thickened. Transfer 1/2 cup lime mixture to small bowl and whisk in mayonnaise; set aside sauce. Add steaks to bowl with remaining marinade and toss thoroughly to coat; transfer steaks and marinade to large zipper-lock bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag. Let steaks sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.

Completely open the bottom vents of a charcoal grill. Light a large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.

Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove steaks from marinade (do not pat dry) and place over hotter part of grill. Cook, uncovered, until well browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer steaks to cooler part of grill, with wider end of each steak facing hotter part of grill. Cover and cook until meat registers 140 degrees, 3 to 8 minutes longer (remove steaks as they come to temperature). Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.

While steaks rest, microwave reserved sauce until warm, 15 to 30 seconds; stir in cilantro. Slice steaks against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle with half of sauce; sprinkle with sea salt, if using; and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings

\\
\textsc{Accompaniments --}
2 cups plain white rice, cooked;
3 heads bibb lettuce, leaves separated, washed and dried;
1 dozen or more fresh oysters (optional);

Place the pork in a large, shallow bowl. Mix the white sugar and 1 cup of the salt together in another bowl, then rub the mixture all over the meat. Cover it with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight.
    
When you're ready to cook, heat oven to 300\deg F. Remove pork from refrigerator and discard any juices. Place the pork in a roasting pan and set in the oven and cook for approximately 6 hours, or until it collapses, yielding easily to the tines of a fork. (After the first hour, baste hourly with pan juices.) At this point, you may remove the meat from the oven and allow it to rest for up to an hour.
    
Meanwhile, make the ginger-scallion sauce. In a large bowl, combine the scallions with the rest of the ingredients. Mix well and taste, adding salt if needed.
    
Make the ssam sauce. In a medium bowl, combine the chili pastes with the vinegar and oil, and mix well.
    
Prepare rice, wash lettuce and, if using, shuck the oysters. Put kimchi and sauces into serving bowls.
    
When your accompaniments are prepared and you are ready to serve the food, turn oven to 500\deg F. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining tablespoon of salt with the brown sugar. Rub this mixture all over the cooked pork. Place in oven for approximately 10 to 15 minutes, or until a dark caramel crust has developed on the meat. Serve hot, with the accompaniments.

Yield: 6 to 10 servings

\recipe{Mississippi Butter-Tomato Sauce}
\label{MStomatoSauce}



\equilpment{13\quarter quart Le Creuset Dutch Oven.}

\ingredients{1 25-pound box end-of-summer Mississippi tomatoes;
6 sticks plus 2 tablespoons (50 tablespoons) butter;
10 medium-sized yellow-onions, peeled and cut in half;
1\half teaspoons table salt.}

\textsc{In her classic recipe for Butter-Tomato Sauce, Marcella Hazan uses plum tomatoes.  This is a sensible choice since plum tomatoes have a high flesh to juice ratio and are intended for cooking. In Mississippi plum potatoes are not common at farmers' markets. However, at the end of the summer Mississippi has abundant and beautiful tomatoes that are perfect for eating fresh. These tomatoes can be used to make an excellent Butter-Tomato Sauce but because of their high juice to flesh ratio additional steps are required to remove their excess juice before they can be used for sauce making.}

Using a large pot of boiling water and an ice bath, peel the tomatoes.  When the peeled tomatoes are cool enough to handle cut them into quarters removing any green stem or green flesh at the same time. Squeeze each quarter by hand to remove the seeds and excess juice saving the juice and seeds separately from the tomato flesh. This process should yield 20 cups (5 quarts) of tomato flesh (adjust the a mounts of the other ingredients proportionally if you have more or less tomato flesh). Strain the juice from the seeds and save in case additional liquid is needed later in the recipe.

Add the tomato quarters to a Dutch oven or stock pot of at least 12 quart capacity. Check the liquid level and, if necessary, add reserved strained juice to bring the level of the liquid to just below the level of the tomato solids. Combine the butter, salt and the onion halves with the tomatoes.

Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Taste and add salt as needed.

Discard the onion then emulsify sauce using an immersion blender. Package sauce in 2-cup portions and freeze for later use.

Yields: Ten 2-cup portions. Each portion is enough for one pound of pasta and 4 servings.

    1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for optional garnish;
    Freshly ground black pepper
}

In a Dutch oven or skillet large enough to hold all the pasta, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the lemon zest and swirl to mix. Remove from heat.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving 1\half cups of the pasta water.

Return the butter to medium heat, then whisk in the reserved pasta water until combined, about 2 minutes. Add the Parmesan in a couple of handfuls, whisking until emulsified, 3 to 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the pasta to the sauce; toss and stir until the noodles are glossed with sauce, 3 to 5 minutes.

Serve with more black pepper and Parmesan.

\chapter{Pizza}
\recipe{Neapolitan Pizza Dough}

\ingredients{500 grams Antico Caputo brand 00 wheat flour;
310 grams water;
10 grams salt;
10 grams agave syrup;
2.5 grams (1\half teaspoons) Bob's Red Mill brand vital wheat gluten;
2.5 grams (\threequarters teaspoon) Active dry yeast;
Neutral oil as needed.}

Mix flour, water, salt, agave syrup, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook until fully incorporated.

Mix on medium speed (4 on KitchenAid mixer) for 5 minutes.

Let the dough rest in the bowl for 10 minutes at room temperature, and then mix again for another 5 minutes at medium speed.
Allowing the gluten to relax between kneading creates an especially smooth, stretchy dough.

Transfer the dough to a well-floured surface, and cut into four equal weight chunks. Stretch and roll the dough into smooth, even balls.
Stretching the surface layer develops a network of gluten that traps air inside the ball, resulting in a lighter, more blistered crust.

Coat the balls lightly with oil, cover them with plastic wrap, and allow them to rise at room temperature for 1 hour before using. For a more complex flavor,
refrigerate the dough balls overnight, and then let them rest at room temperature for 1 hour before using.

Yields enough dough for four 12-14 inch pizzas.  The dough keeps for 3 days when refrigerated in plastic wrap or up to 3 months when frozen.

1 tablespoon dark rum or kirsch.}

To poach the pears first make a syrup by bring the water and sugar to boil in a saucepan. Peel pears, cut in half, then remove stem and seeds. Poach pears in simmering syrup until cooked through but still firm enough to hold together. Remove pear halves from syrup and allow to cool. Cook down syrup until reduced to a glaze then cool and reserve glaze. 

Preheat the oven to 425\deg F.

To make the tart pastry, place the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Cut in the butter in slices, and buzz several times until the mixture is uniform and resembles coarse meal.  Continue to process in quick spurts as you add water, 1 tablespoon at at time. As soon as the dough adheres to itself when pinched together, stop adding water, turn it out onto a floured surface, and push it together into a ball. 

Butter the tart pan then roll the dough into an 11-inch or so circle. Drape the dough over your rolling pin and the lift the dough into the tart pan, nudging it gently into the corners, and use your hands to form an even edge all the way around. Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork. Wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator until assembly. 

To make the filling, us a mixer to mix butter, sugar, and almond flour, until the dough is smooth, add the rum, then the beaten egg. Work until the mixture is homogeneous, then add the flour and mix completely.

To assemble tart place poached pears radially around the center of the tart pan with the cut sides down and the stems pointed at the center. Pour the filling evenly around the pears leaving most of the pear exposed. Bake for 45 minutes then remove from oven and pour reserved glaze evenly over tart.  The tart will absorb the glaze after a few minutes so you can continue to pour over glaze until it is all used.  Let cool to room temperature before removing from the pan and serving.

2 tablespoons butter;
1 large egg;
3 \half cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour;
\quarter cup sugar;
1\quarter teaspoons salt;
1 tablespoon instant yeast}

In a heavy duty mixer with the dough hook attached, mix and then knead all of the dough ingredients to make a soft, smooth dough.

Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, or until it's nearly doubled in bulk.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 8 pieces. Shape each piece into a round ball; flatten to about 3 inches across. Place the buns on a silicon baking mat in a half sheet pan, cover, and let rise for about an hour, until noticeably puffy.

Bake the buns in a preheated 375\deg F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden.
Cool the buns on a rack.

Brushing buns with melted butter will give them a soft, light golden crust. Brushing with an egg-white wash (1 egg white beaten with 1/4 cup water) will give them a shinier, darker crust. For seeded buns, brush with the egg wash; it'll make the seeds adhere. And, feel free to add the extra yolk to the dough, reserving the white for the wash.

Yield: 8 large buns.

\recipe{Chicken Enchiladas with Sour Cream}

\ingredients{2 whole chicken breasts;
2 cups water;
1 teaspoon salt;
1 small carrot, chopped coarse or whole;
1 small onion, quartered;
2 sprigs parsley;
1 stalk celery, quartered;
2 cups grated cheddar cheese;
1 pint sour cream;
4 tablespoons olive oil;
1 clove garlic, chopped;
1 16-oz can chopped green chiles (I had to use four 4 oz. cans of chopped green chiles, which got a little pricey they were Ortega brand, Anaheim chiles);
5 medium ripe tomatoes, peeled and chopped;
2 medium onions, chopped fine;
\half teaspoon dried oregano;
\half teaspoon salt;
1 cup chicken broth (from poaching);
Canola oil for frying;
12 corn tortillas (the small taco kind).}

To poach chicken: Put chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Bring water to a boil and add all other ingredients. Cover pot and simmer for about 45 minutes; chicken should be cooked through (meat will look white and have a flakey texture). Take off heat and let chicken cool in broth.

Meanwhile, peel tomatoes: This is actually very easy, as long as you don't try to do it with a knife. Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Once it's boiling, add the tomatoes, whole. Cook for about 5 minutes, until skins start to peel off. Let the tomatoes cool in the water; when you remove them, you should be able to just pull the skins off with your hands. After peeling, chop roughly.

Meanwhile meanwhile (while the water is boiling for the tomatoes and the chicken is poaching), prep other items (this is when I grated the cheese, chopped the garlic and onions, and opened my cans of chiles).

Now back to the chicken: Strain chicken and vegetables, reserving the broth. ``Shred'' the chicken, pulling it apart with the grain into relatively small flakes of meat (this will make sense once you have the poached chicken). Mix chicken with half (1 cup) of the grated cheese and all the sour cream to the shredded chicken and mix thoroughly. Set aside.
  
Around now would be a good time to preheat the oven to 350\deg F.
  

Prepare green chile sauce: heat olive oil in a medium pot. Add garlic and sauté until golden. Add chiles, tomatoes, onions, oregano, and salt. Add broth and cook over low heat until liquid is reduced by half (about 15-20 minutes). Set aside.

Okay, enchilada assembly time! This is where it gets fun. Set up as assembly line with a frying pan on the stove, the bowl of chicken mix, the green chile sauce, a flat surface to work on (I used a cutting board with paper towels covering it to absorb the oil), and the pan the enchiladas are eventually going to land in.

a.    Then heat the oil in a frying pan. I worked 2 tortillas at a time -- you could do more if your cutting board is bigger than mine. Fry each tortilla individually, just for a few seconds on each side until it puffs slightly. Remove with tongs or a spatula and let drain on the paper towel covered cutting board (turn it over at some point so both sides can drain).

b.    Divide the chicken mix in half, and then divide each half into six parts, roughly. Spoon 1/12 of chicken mixture onto tortilla and top with 2 tbsp. of green chile sauce.

c.    Roll the enchilada. For me, this ended up being more like folding it twice.

d.    Place ``rolled'' enchilada into 9 inch by 13 inch pan; fill pan so enchiladas are snug.

When all enchiladas are assembled, cover with remaining sauce and cheese and bake for 15 minutes (uncovered, until thoroughly heated). The Pink Adobe recommends serving the enchiladas with chopped lettuce and Corona Extra beer. A cookbook after my own heart.

peanut oil for frying.}
\textsc{Serve these hot from the fryer.  To eat, tear off one end of the sopaipilla and pour in  honey.}

Sift dry ingredients together then work in shortening and lukewarm water to make a soft dough. Place dough in refrigerator until chilled through. Roll out dough on a floured surface to about \quarter inch thickness and then cut into 3 inch squares. Deep fry at 400\deg F a few at the time until puffed being sure to brown on both sides.  Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.

\newpage
\recipe{Flour Tortillas}
\ingredients{455 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling;
1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt;
1 teaspoon baking powder;
\twothirds  vegetable shortening (may substitute for unsalted butter or lard), plus more for coating;
1\quarter cups hot water.}

Using your hands (or a whisk), combine the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl.

In a large bowl, beat the vegetable shortening with your hand in circular motions to warm it up and spread it in the bottom of the bowl, until it is creamed and there are no lumps, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and mix it with the shortening, in circular motions, wiping the bowl as you mix, until the fat is evenly distributed through the flour, for about 1 or 2 minutes.

Distribute the water over the mixture and mix it into the flour in a circular motion, scraping from the bottom and folding and kneading the dough pressing it from the center out to the edges of the bowl. At first it will be very sticky and lumpy, but as you continue to knead, it will become more elastic, soft and homogenous, more light, less dense and springy to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rest for 20 minutes.

Using your fingers, pinch off a heaping 1\half inch ball of the dough. (You should have about 12 pieces, each about 70 grams.) Roll each piece into a ball and place on a baking sheet or board. Rub a bit of vegetable shortening in the palm of your hands and roll each ball of dough between your palms to coat it with the shortening. You may need to repeat adding vegetable shortening to your hands about 4 to 5 times to go over the 12 balls. Cover with a towel and let rest for 20 minutes.

Heat your comal, griddle, or cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for at least 5 minutes.

Lightly flour your work surface and your rolling pin. Roll one ball into a 9-inch tortilla. You will need to rotate the tortilla on your work surface about 5 or 6 times as you roll it out, flip and add more flour as needed. Do not get discouraged if the tortilla does't make a perfect round; it takes lots of practice!

As soon as you are done rolling out a tortilla, using both hands, lay it on the hot comal, in a swift and determined way so it doesn't break. After 40 to 50 seconds there should be brown freckles on the bottom side and air bubbles on top. Using a spatula and your hand, flip the tortilla over and cook for another 40 to 50 seconds, until the other side is freckled and the tortilla puffs up even more. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel and keep covered.

Repeat with the remaining dough and as you cook the tortillas. If you don't eat all of them at once, let them cool then place them in a plastic bag and seal the bag. They will keep fresh, out of the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 days. You can also store them in your refrigerator for up to a week. When ready to eat, take them out and reheat on a preheated comal, griddle or skillet over medium low heat, for a minute or so per side. (It is very important that you preheat the comal or skillet before adding the tortillas so that they don't stick or burn.)

\recipe{Wine Vinegar}
\label{WineVinegar}
\equilpment{2 quart-size wide-mouth mason jars with rings; cheese cloth.}
\ingredients{750 ml bottle of ``over the hill'' red wine; \half teaspoon 3\% hydrogen peroxide solution; ; 750 ml purified water; 250 ml fluid ounces organic apple cider vinegar with mother.}

Add the hydrogen peroxide solution to the bottle of wine and give it a good shake. Wait for 10 minutes before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  This step is necessary to neutralize the sulfides in the wine.

Pour half of the wine in each of the mason jars and then add an amount of purified water equal to the amount of wine in each bottle.  Each jar should contain a mixture of 375 ml of wine with 375 ml of water. Shake the bottle of cider vinegar to get the mother into solution then add 125 ml of vinegar to each jar.  Stir the contents of the jars and then cover the jars with cheese cloth.  The jar rings can be used to hold the cheese cloth in place.

Put the jars in a dark cupboard. Every week or two give the jars a shake and check the progress of the vinegar. The vinegar is done when almost all of the alcohol has been converted to acetic acid. This will take several months.

\recipe{Smoked Meatloaf}

\equilpment{Disposable aluminum or standard loaf pan large enough to hold meat loaf;
plastic wrap or wax paper;
frogmat non-stick grill mat, cookie cooling rack or small grill.}

\ingredients{
2 pounds  ground beef;
1 pound ground sausage  (breakfast or mild Italian);
\half cup finely chopped celery;
\half cup finely chopped onion;
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic;
2 tablespoon olive oil;
2 eggs;
2 cup bread crumbs, (more or less as needed to bind);
1 pound Bacon, regular slice (to wrap);
1 cup Cheddar cheese, grated
} 


Saut\'{e} garlic and onions in the olive oil until onions are just translucent. Mix together ground beef, sausage, celery, onion, garlic, eggs and just enough bread crumbs to bind the mixture together.

Remove bacon from package and set aside three slices. On a cutting board lay the remaining slices in a five by seven strip ``basket weave'' pattern. Place plastic wrap or wax paper over the bacon and invert the loaf pan on top. A standard five pound disposable aluminum pan  (11\threequarters" x\, 5\fiveeights" x  3\threesixteenths") works well for this application. Holding the loaf pan in place while inverting the cutting board so as to allow the plastic wrap or wax paper and bacon to drape into  the pan with the bacon running up the sides. Divide the loaf mixture in half. Place one half of the loaf mixture into the pan on top of the bacon. Flatten it out. Place cheese in center of the meat mixture running almost to the ends. Cover with remaining loaf mixture. Fold any loose ends of the bacon on top of the meat loaf. Cover with remaining three bacon slices.

Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours. Remove from the mold by inverting it on to a Frogmat if you have one or a small cookie sheet or grill to make it easier to handle.

Preheat smoker to 250\deg F. Insert a meat thermometer into the center of the loaf. Place loaf in smoker and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160\deg F. This will take two to two and a half hours. 

When done, remove and let stand for fifteen minutes before carving.

\recipe{Hummus}
\label{Hummus}
\equilpment{14 cup heavy-duty food processor; 6 quart Dutch oven}
\ingredients{1 pound dried chickpeas;
2 teaspoons baking soda;
12 cups (3 quarts) water;
16 ounce jar Soom tahini;
8 tablespoons (4 ounces or \half cup) lemon juice;
8 cloves garlic, pealed;
1 tablespoon salt;
6 to 7 ounces ice-cold water}

The night before, put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with cold water at least twice their volume. Leave to soak overnight.

The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a Dutch oven over high heat and add the drained chickpeas and baking soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the water and bring to a boil. Cook at a rolling boil, skimming off any foam and any skins that float to the surface. The chickpeas will need to cook between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

Drain the chickpeas. Place the chickpeas in a food processor and process until you get a stiff paste. Then with the machine still running, add the tahini paste, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix for about 5 minutes, until you get a very smooth and creamy paste.

Refrigerate or freeze in 1 or 2 cup portions. Cover the surface of the hummus with plastic wrap to avoid the formation of a skin. Defrost frozen hummus in the refrigerator overnight. Allow refrigerated hummus to come to room temperature before serving by leaving is on the counter for 30 minutes.

Makes approximately 8 cups.

3 whole cloves;
1 teaspoon  whole celery seeds;
1 medium red beet, grated (optional);
1 small onion, sliced in rings;
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced;
1 teaspoon caraway seeds;
sprig or two of fresh dill.
}

\textsc{My mother, Mallette Goggans, often made these eggs for parties.  Her recipe uses 15 dozen peewee eggs and a gallon of vinegar. I have scaled her recipe down to one dozen medium eggs so that it fits in a single one-quart canning jar. The beet in the recipe is just for color and can be omitted. When placing the eggs in the jar try to stand then up and place onions around then so that they do not touch the side of the jar.  That way the eggs will be uniformly colored and pickled. Pickled eggs may be kept several months in the pickling solution in the refrigerator.  The  eggs can be drained and served as is or sliced in half and used to make deviled eggs. }

Combine vinegar, sugar, salt peppercorns, cloves, celery seeds and grated beet in a sauce pan and bring to a simmer.  Simmer picking liquid for around 5 minutes then strain reserving liquid.

While pickling liquid is simmering, layer eggs, onions, garlic and dill in a one-quart wide-mouth canning jar.  Sprinkle caraway seeds over eggs in jar then pour strained liquid over eggs, onions, and garlic until covered. Place lid and ring on jar and tighten.  Place jar in the refrigerator  and marinate for at least 2 days although 2 weeks is better.

\chapter{ Charcuterie}
\recipe{Sausage and Chicken Liver P\^{a}t\'{e}}

\ingredients{1 pound raw thin sliced bacon strips;
1 pound chicken liver;
1 pound ground pork breakfast sausage;
2 large eggs;
2 or 3 cloves of garlic;
1 medium onion diced;
1 tablespoon diced parsley;
1 tablespoon brandy or cognac (Optional or use 3 tablespoons sherry);
1 teaspoon thyme;
1 teaspoon salt;
\eighth teaspoon black pepper;
\eighth teaspoon rosemary;
3 or 4 whole bay leaves for top of p\^{a}t\'{e}.}

Put a parchment paper sling in a 6 to 8 cup p\^{a}t\'{e}  mold (a bread pan works fine) and then line the mold with the
raw bacon strips letting the ends flop over the sides of the mold.  Use whole strips of bacon across the short side of the mold just overlapping the strip.  On the ends of the long side of the mold use bacon strip cut in half.  The sling is used to as an aid when unmolding the p\^{a}t\'{e} and is particularly important if a glass mold is used since in this case the mold can not be slammed against the platter without risk of breaking the glass.

Place all of the remaining ingredients except for the bay
leaves in a food processor or blender and process until liquefied.

Pour the liver mixture into the p\^{a}t\'{e} mold, top with the bay
leaves, and fold the end of the bacon over the mixture.

Cover the mold with foil and bake at 225 \deg F for 3 hours.  The internal temperature should be greater than 160 \deg F.

Remove from oven and pour off the excess fat from the p\^{a}t\'{e}.  As long as the specified internal temperature is reached, you should not be concerned if the excess fat you pour off is a little pink. Place a brick or
other heavy object on top of the foil to press the p\^{a}t\'{e} and leave
in the refrigerator overnight.

Unmold p\^{a}t\'{e} onto a platter
and garnish with greenery or strips of roasted red and/or yellow
bell pepper.  Serve with slices of \hyperref[SweetPickles]{sweet pickle} and Dijon mustard
on French bread.

Combine the pork chunks, salt, grated garlic, nutmeg, ginger, black pepper and sour cream  in a large bowl and toss with clean hands until homogeneous. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Rinse salt off casings and place in a bowl with cold water to soak.  Casings should soak for around 30 minutes.

Place bag with pork mixture in freezer for around 30 minutes then grind mixture using a 4.5 mm plate. Grind into a bowl other than the KitchenAid mixer bowl. Feed a piece of stale bread through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. 


Add 2 ounces of water and half of the ground meat to the mixer bowl. With the mixer's paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Remove mixed sausage and repeat with an additional 2 ounces of water and the remaining ground meat. Load sausage into stuffer. 

Place open end of casing on the end of the kitchen faucet and inflate with water until fully inflated. Drain and place on \seveneights" (2.2 cm) diameter stuffer tube. Tie a knot in the end of the casing and evenly fill with sausage. Stop before the end of the casing and tie off with another knot.  Divide into links and twist to separate. 

Makes around 16 8-inch links.

\recipe{Texas German Sausage}
\label{TexasSausage}
\equilpment{KitchenAid Mixer; LEM \#5 Electric Meat Grinder; LEM Mighty Bite Sausage Stuffer; KBQ C-60 BBQ Smoker.}

\ingredients{1.7 kilograms beef brisket;
300 grams pork shoulder;
26.5 grams Kosher salt;
1 gram ground cayenne pepper;
15 grams fresh and coarsely ground black pepper;
3.5 grams cure \#1;
4 3-foot sections of natural hog casings for sausage (e.g. Natural Hog Casings for Sausage by Oversea Casing);
180 grams cold water;
28 grams dry milk powder;
 split oak logs for smoking.}

\textsc{This is my attempt to produce East Texas style German sausage like the Original Smoked Sausage made by Kreuz Market in Lockhart, Texas. According to their web site, Kreuz sausage is 85\% beef and 15\% pork, smoked using post oak, and seasoned using only salt, pepper and cayenne. This recipe has the same percentages of beef and pork as Kreuz sausage, is smoked using oak, and is seasoned with salt, black pepper and cayenne.}

Trim the brisket and port shoulder so the meat to be made into sausage is around 70\% lean and 30\% fat. Weigh out the required portions of brisket and pork shoulder and then
cut the brisket and pork shoulder into one-inch cubes. 

In a large metal or glass bowl, combine the meat cubes with the salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and cure \#1.

Mix thoroughly with gloved hands, making sure the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the meat. Transfer to a two-gallon zipper-lock bag and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Rinse salt off casings and place in a bowl with cold water to soak.  Casings should soak for around 30 minutes.

Place meat grinder head and bag with beef and pork mixture in freezer for around 30 minutes then grind mixture using a 10 mm plate. Grind into a large metal bowl. Feed a piece of stale bread or a sheet of paper towel through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. Return meat grinder head and ground meat mixture to freezer for 15 minutes then grind the meat mixture a second time with the 4.5 mm plate.

Add half the water and half the milk powder to the mixer bowl containing half the ground meat. With the mixer's paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Repeat with the remaining water, milk powder, and ground meat. Load sausage into stuffer. 

Place open end of casing on the end of the kitchen faucet and inflate with water until fully inflated. Drain and place on medium stuffer tube. Tie a knot in the end of the casing and evenly fill with sausage. Stop before the end of the casing and tie off with another knot.  Divide the 3-foot sections into 6 links and twist to separate. After twisting there should be approximately \threequarters inch between links. 


Arrange the sausage links on a half-sheet pan then place the pan in refrigerator on the bottom shelf to chill before smoking. If it is convenient you can leave the sausages in the refrigerator overnight and smoke them the next day. Pull the sausages out of the refrigerator an hour before smoking in order to allow the casings to dry at room temperature.

Start a fire in the KBQ C-60 smoker and preheat to 160\deg F. Half open the upper and lower smoke selector outlets on the  smoker.  When the temperature in the smoker is stable, place the sausage links on racks around the middle of the smoker. Cook until  the sausages reach an internal temperature of 154\deg F.  The sausages will take about 3 hours to reach the desired temperature.
   
Once the sausages are out of the smoker, it is important to cool them down as quickly as possible to avoid shriveled skins. Do this by placing the links in a cold water bath until they are room temperature or slightly cooler.


Blooming, or allowing the sausages to develop flavor at room temperature, is an important final step before enjoying your sausages. Hang them on a rack suspended between the backs of two chairs or any setup where they will have plenty of air exposure. The smoky flavor will continue to develop and spread throughout the sausage for a few hours. 

After blooming, you should store the finished sausage in a refrigerator where it will keep for 3-4 days. If you vacuum seal the sausages, they will last in a freezer for up to nine months.

Makes around 2 kilograms of links.

To serve the sausages, preheat oven to 275\deg F, place the sausages in oven and heat for 10 to 20 minutes. Or, even better, brown on a grill over lump charcoal. By the time the sausages are browned all over they will be heated through.

\half cup light brown sugar;
1 tablespoon black peppercorns;
1\half teaspoons allspice berries; \half teaspoons chopped candied ginger; 1 gallons heavily iced water;
1 red apple, sliced; \half onion, sliced; 1 cup water; 4 sprigs rosemary; 6 leaves sage; Canola oil
}


To make the brine, combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice berries, and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally to dissolve solids and bring to a boil. Then remove the brine from the heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate.  

Combine the brine, water and ice in a 20 liter cooler. Place the turkey (with innards removed) breast side down in brine. If necessary, weigh down the bird to ensure it is fully immersed. Set cooler in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once half way through brining.

Set the oven rack to it lowest level and preheat the oven to 500 \deg F. Remove the bird from brine and rinse inside and out with cold water. Discard the brine. 

Place the bird on wire rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper towels.


Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey's cavity along with the rosemary and sage. Tuck the wings underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil.  

Fold an 18'' foil square in half along the diagonal to form a right isosceles triangle. Coat one flat side of the triangle with Canola oil and then form to the breast of the turkey with the 90\deg angle pointed to the front of the bird and the 45\deg angles pointing at the wings.  Remove the foil triangle without bending it and set aside.


Put the turkey in the oven with legs first if it will fit this way. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 500 \deg F for 30 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 \deg F. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and place the foil triangle on the breast.  Set the thermometer alarm to 161 \deg F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2\half hours of roasting. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil for at least 15 minutes before carving. Alternatively, the cooked turkey can be held for up to 90 minutes in a large closed cooler.  Put the turkey on a quarter sheet pan (or serving plater) and then place in  cooler. Cover the turkey with foil before closing the cooler.

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley;
1 tsp. dried sage;
1/2 tsp. dried tarragon;
1 recipe of \hyperref[cornbread]{corn bread} made in a skillet, crumbled;
2 eggs;
Pinch cayenne;
Salt and freshly ground black pepper;
Crisco;
Chicken Stock (less than 1 cup needed);
1 pt. to 1.5 pt. shucked Gulf oysters (3 dozen small shucked oysters).}

Make \hyperref[cornbread]{corn bread} in a cast iron skillet.
Grease skillet generously with Crisco and preheat in oven before adding 
batter so that the corn bread develops a thick brown crisp crust. 
Cool corn bread and then crumble. Two cups of corn meal mix made into
corn bread should yield around 6 cups of crumbled corn bread.

Preheat oven to 350 \deg F.  Melt 6 tbsp. of butter in a skillet over medium heat, 
add onions, celery, parsley, sage, tarragon, and cayenne.  Sweat the mixture 
until the vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes, then cool.

Drain and reserve the oyster liquid.  If using large oysters cut each oyster 
into 2 or 3 pieces.  Measure the oyster liquid and add enough chicken stock 
(or water) to bring the total to 1 cup.  Transfer liquid to a small sauce pan, 
add the remaining 6 tbsp. of butter, then bring to a simmer, stirring until 
butter has melted.

In a large mixing bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs then add the crumbled corn bread
and mix to combine.  Add vegetable mixture, season with salt (around 1 tbsp. 
if you use unsalted butter) and pepper (1 tsp. or more to taste) 
then mix to combine.  Pour the liquid/butter mixture over the corn bread 
mixture and combine by working with hands.  The mixture should be
uniformly moist but not wet. Add additional chicken stock if mixture is too dry.
Finally, gently mix oysters into corn bread mixture, taking care not

Notes

I made a double recipe for Thanksgiving 2012.  
For the double recipe I used my blue Le Creuset baking pan both to make the 
corn bread and to make the dressing.  For the double recipe I increased the 
cooking time to 60 minutes and finished browning the top using the broiler 
on high for a minute or two.

I made a single recipe for Thanksgiving 2014. I used my black high sided Le Creuset baking pan. In this pan I cooked the recipe for 55 minute and then browned the top under the broiler on high.  I used 4 or 5 dozen large oysters cut in half. I had enough oyster liquid and so did not need the chicken stock.

\recipe{Persimmon Pudding}
\label{PersimmonPudding}
\ingredients{2 cup persimmon pulp $\approx$ pulp from 5 or 6 Japanese-hybrid  persimmons;
3 eggs beaten;
1\half cups sugar;
2 cups whole milk;
2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour;
1 teaspoon baking soda;
1 teaspoon salt.}

\textsc{Around 1967 my father, Floyd Goggans, planted a dwarf Tanenashi
persimmon tree in the yard of the house at Kuderna Acres.  Every
year the persimmons ripened just in time to make persimmon pudding
for Thanksgiving dinner. My mother,  Mallette Goggans, often served this pudding with
a hard sauce made with bourbon.  I use the hard sauce recipe from
Joy of Cooking made with rye whisky and cream. Be sure to use
truly ripe persimmons.  A ripe persimmon is very soft. Its pulp is
like a thick gel and contains no solid bits.}

In mixing bowl combine all ingredients stirring until blended.

Pour mixture into a 8 cup metal mold. The pudding will
rise when cooked so do not completely fill the mold.

Place uncovered mold inside a large covered pot.

Pour boiling water in the pot to slightly below the top of the mold.

Adjust the stove top so that the water in the pot simmers slowly.

Cover the pot and then steam the pudding until it has a cake-pudding
texture.  This step will take around 3 hours.

Remove pudding and cool in refrigerator.

\recipe{Prime Rib Roast -- Oven Roast}
\label{PrimeRibRoastOven}
\ingredients{Prime-grade prime rib roast, trimmed and tied (2-3 servings per bone); kosher salt; black pepper, freshly ground.}

Buy a bone-in, prime-grade prime rib, preferably dry-aged. Season well with salt and pepper, and let it rest, uncovered, on a rack in the refrigerator for at least overnight and up to four days. 

Roast in a 200\deg F oven until it hits 125\deg F at the center (around four to five hours for an average rib roast; your mileage may vary). Remove from the oven, tent lightly with aluminum foil, and let it rest at least 30 minutes and up to one and a half hours. 

Ten minutes before serving, remove the foil, pour off fat from pan and place it back into an oven preheated to its highest possible setting (500-550\deg F). Roast until well browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Carve and serve immediately. 

To carve, grab bone with a clean kitchen towel and carve off bone from roast. Cut apart rib bones and carve roast into \half inch thick slices.

Notes from Christmas 2021: Cooked 4 bone 8.8 pound prime-grade trimmed and tied roast to serve 8 people. Even with large servings there was plenty left over. The roast went in a 200\deg F oven at 12:25 PM. The internal temperature when the roast went in the oven was 42.6\deg F. At 1:45 PM the internal temperature was 59.2\deg F.   At 2:15 PM the internal temperature was 71.1\deg F.  At 4:08 PM the internal temperature was 112.5\deg F. At 4:51 PM the internal temperature was 125.2\deg F and the roast was removed from the oven and tented with foil. The internal temperature was 135.5\deg F when the roast was served at 6:10 PM.

\recipe{Prime Rib Roast -- Sous Vide}
\label{PrimeRibRoastSousVide}
\ingredients{7 pound prime-grade prime rib roast with \half inch fat cap (3 bones); kosher salt; black pepper, freshly ground; 1 tablespoon vegtable oil.}

To remove bones from roast, use sharp knife and run it down length of bones, following contours as closely as possible; set bones aside. Cut slits in surface layer of fat on roast, spaced 1 inch apart, in crosshatch pattern, being careful to cut down to, but not into, meat. Rub 2 tablespoons salt over entire roast and into slits. Place meat back on bones (to save space in refrigerator), transfer to plate, and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 24 hours or up to 96 hours.

Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 133\deg F/56\deg C in 12-quart container.

Separate meat and bones; set aside bones. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Sear sides and top of roast until browned, 6 to 8 minutes (do not sear side where roast was cut from bone). Place meat back on ribs so bones fit where they were cut, and let cool for 10 minutes. Tie meat to bones between ribs with 2 lengths of kitchen twine.
   
Season roast with pepper and place in 2-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until roast is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 16 hours or up to 24 hours.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat broiler. Set wire rack in aluminum foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable spray. Transfer roast, fat side up, to prepared rack and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Pat roast dry with paper towels. Crumple 12-inch piece of foil into 3-inch ball and place under ribs to elevate fat cap. Broil until surface of roast is browned and crisp, 4 to 8 minutes.

Transfer roast to carving board and discard ribs. Slice meat into \threequarters inch thick slices.

Notes from Christmas 2022: Cooked a 3 bone 6.5 pound roast from Home Place Pastures to serve 9 people. With okay sized slices there was enough to serve everyone with very little left over. The roast was cooked Sous Vide using a recipe from America's Test Kitchen.

Notes from Christmas 2023: Cooked a 3 bone 4.9 pound roast from Porter Road to serve 7 people.  With good sized pieces there was enough to serve everyone with none left over.

\recipe{Crispy Roast Potatoes}
\label{CrispyRoastPotatoes}

\ingredients{Kosher salt;
\half teaspoon (4 g) baking soda;
4 pounds (about 2 kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size;
5 tablespoons (75 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat;
Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped;
3 medium cloves garlic, minced;
Freshly ground black pepper;
small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced.}

Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450\deg F (230\deg C) (or 400\deg F (200\deg C) if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25 g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato-like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.

Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

Serves 6 to 8.

Notes:

Russet potatoes will produce crisper crusts and fluffier centers. Yukon Golds will be slightly less crisp and have creamier centers, with a darker color and deeper flavor. You can also use a mix of the two.

The potatoes should be cut into very large chunks, at least 2 to 3 inches or so. For medium-sized Yukon Golds, this means cutting them in half crosswise, then splitting each half again to make quarters. For larger Yukon Golds or russets, you can cut the potatoes into chunky sixths or eighths.

\recipe{Cantaloupe Liqueur}
\label{CantaloupeLiqueur}

\ingredients{1000 grams cantaloupe pulp, finely chopped; 500 ml  95\% ABV Neutral (Everclear); 500 ml purified water; 400 grams cane sugar.}

For this recipe you will need a 2-liter glass container with an airtight seal (two 1-quart Mason jars will also work). For the best results, use a very ripe cantaloupe and carefully remove every bit of peel before finely dicing the pulp.

Put the cantaloupe pulp in the glass container, cover with the alcohol and then the seal container. Macerate for 30 days in a cool dark place shaking the mixture every now and then.

After 30 days strain the cantaloupe pulp from the alcohol using a wire mesh strainer.  Press hard on the pulp to remove all the liquid and then discard the pulp. Clean the glass container and return the flavored alcohol to it. 

Prepare the syrup by bring the water and sugar to a boil then reducing heat to a simmer and stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cool the syrup to room temperature before adding it to flavored alcohol. Stir well to combine, seal the jar and let it rest for 1 week before proceeding.

Filter the liqueur using a double layer of muslin moistened with alcohol. Filter again and returned to rinsed bottle. Seal the bottle and place it where it will not be disturbed to allow the fine particles to settle to the bottom.  When the liquid above a thin layer of particles on the bottom of the bottle is very clear, rack off the clear liquid and transfer to an attractive bottle.

\recipe{Making Gin}

\textsc{Gin is just neutral spirits that is flavored with juniper and other botanicals using a still. The first step in making gin is to make or buy neutral sprits. Making neutral spirits from scratch that is neutral enough in flavor to use in making quality gin requires a column still and hard won experience in using it. Because of this most people are better off purchasing neutral spirits from the liquor store. For these recipe you can use either bottom shelf 80 proof vodka that is already 40\% ABV or 95\% ABV neutral spirits (e.g. Everclear) diluted to 40\% ABV.}

\textsc{I don't crush the juniper berries in these recipe for two reasons. First, using crushed berries gives inconsistent results because is it difficult to crush uniformly and consistently. Second, I find that crushed berries release harsh flavors that whole berries do not. For similar reasons I don't macerate the botanicals in the spirits before distilling.}

\textsc{I put the fresh citrus zest in the gin basket because I like the fresh citrus flavor that results better than the marmalade like flavor that results from putting the zest into the still with the spirits. I also put fresh flowers in the gin basket so that more of their aroma transfers to the gin.}

\textsc{In these gin recipes the first 25 ml of distillate to emerge from the still is discarded to control the amount of juniper and citrus oil in the final product.  Without this step the gin is likely to louch (turn cloudy) when water is added to it and have too much harsh juniper and citrus flavor. }

\textsc{To give your gin additional ``mouth feel'' add 9 ml of USP glycerin to each 750 ml bottle of finished gin.}

\textsc{For your first attempt at making gin try \hyperref[GinNumber1]{Gin \#1} or, for the more adventurous, \hyperref[GinNumber7]{Gin \#7}}. Both of these gins mimic well known commercial brands. 

\newpage

\recipe{Gin \#1}
\label{GinNumber1}

\ingredients{1 liter 40\% ABV neutral spirits;
15 grams juniper berries, whole;
7.5 grams coriander seeds, whole; 
1.5 grams angelica root, coarsely ground;
2 grams liquorice root, coarsely ground.
}

\textsc{These are the four botanicals used in Tanqueray gin.}

Do not crush the juniper berries or coriander seeds. Using an electric spice grinder, coarsely grind the angelica root and the liquorice root. Add all ingredients to the still.  Turn on still and after the first drip from the still at around 17 minutes collect the first 25 ml of distillate to emerge (discard or save the first 25 ml in a jar labeled ``Gin \#1 Feints'').  After this collect the next 425-450 ml of distillate. This distillate is used to make the gin. To increase the efficiency of future gin runs you can collect the next 200 ml and save it in the same feints jar as the first 25 ml. The contents of the feints jar can be added to the still with the botanicals the next time you make Gin \#1.

To make the gin, dilute the collected 425-450 ml of distillate with purified water to 45\% ABV. The result should be approximately 750 ml of gin. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize.

If the gin has too much juniper flavor to suit you then 
add 45\% ABV neutral spirits (can be made by diluting 95\% ABV neutral spirits) to the gin to reduce the flavor. To make your gin similar in intensity to Tanqueray gin this step is necessary.

\ingredients{
1 liter 40\% ABV neutral spirits;

1 gram angelica root, coarsely ground;
0.2 grams cardamom seeds, coarsely ground; 
0.1 grams vanilla bean;
0.5 grams fresh lemon thyme leaves;
2 grams hazelnut pieces, lightly toasted;
35 grams peeled and seeded ripe pear (or apple if pear is unavailable); 0.7 grams dried bitter orange peel, coarsely ground (optional);
\half teaspoon honey (optional)
2 gram fresh rose petals or 1 gram dried rose petals;
4 grams fresh lemon or orange zest.
} 

Do not crush the juniper berries or the coriander seeds. Add all ingredients except the rose petals and fresh orange or lemon zest to the still. For a very citrus forward gin you can use up to 8 grams of fresh citrus zest, however, you will likely have to correct the diluted gin for louching if you do.  Zest the orange or lemon with a sharp vegetable peeler and add zest strips and rose petals wrapped in cheese cloth to the gin basket.  Turn on still and after the first drip from the still at around 17 minutes collect and discard the first 25 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next 425-450 ml of distillate for use in making the gin. Dilute the collected distillate with purified water to 45\% ABV. The result should be approximately 750 ml of gin. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize.

If the gin has too much juniper or citrus flavor to suit you then 
add 45\% ABV neutral spirits (can be made by diluting 95\% ABV neutral spirits) to the gin to reduce the flavor. Similarly, to correct louching, add 45\% ABV neutral spirits to your gin until it is clear.

\textsc{Bombay Sapphire recipe according to an article in Wired Magazine.}

\textsc{Because this it the gin I most commonly make, I sometimes measure out 5 or 10 times the amount of botanical,  minus the fresh lemon zest, and store them in a sealed glass bottle in the freezer so I can quickly measure out the amount of botanicals to make single recipe at a later time.  To make measuring out the botanical mix easier it is important to very coursly grind the ground botanicals.    Minus the fresh lemon zest, there are 33 grams of botanicals in this recipe.}

Do not crush the juniper berries, coriander seeds, cubeb pepper berries, or the grains of paradise. Add all ingredients except the fresh lemon zest to the still.   Zest a fresh clean lemon with a sharp vegetable peeler and add zest strips to the gin basket.

300 grams fresh ripe mulberries;
500 ml of approximately 74\% ABV gin.\\
\\
\textsc{Mulberry Syrup}
75 grams fresh ripe mulberries;
150 grams sugar;
75 ml water.

 In northern Mississippi mulberries usually ripen during the last weeks of May so this is the time to make this gin. Begin by making your favorite gin recipe.  Using the instructions given in the recipe for \hyperref[GinNumber7]{Gin \#7}, starting with 1 liter 40\% ABV neutral spirits in the still, and collect 500 ml of approximately 74\% ABV gin. To make the mulberry macerate, place the fresh mulberries and 74\% ABV gin in a 1 quart Mason jar. Put the jar in a dark pantry for two of months. 
 
 While fresh mulberries are available, make the mulberry syrup. Begin by making a rich simple syrup adding the fresh mulberries while the syrup is hot. When cool, strain the syrup to remove the mulberries and place strained syrup in the refrigerator until needed to sweeten and proof down the gin.
 
 After two months, strain the gin off of the mulberries pressing to extract as much gin and mulberry juice as possible.  Measure the volume of the extracted gin.  Assuming that no ethanol was lost in the maceration process, determine the volume of syrup and additional water that must be added so that the final mulberry gin is approximately 40\% ABV. Add all the syrup and then water to bring the added volume up that necessary to achieve 40\% ABV. Bottle in 325 ml clear bottles. Makes around 900 ml of mulberry gin.

\recipe{Muscadine  Gin Liqueur -- In Development}


\ingredients{\\
\\
\textsc{Muscidine Syrup}
300 grams hulls from very-ripe  dark-colored muscadines (e.g. Carlos); 300 ml water; 600 grams sugar.\\
\\
\textsc{Double-Strength Gin-Concentrate}
2000 ml 40\% ABV Neural Spirits;
60 grams juniper berries, whole;
30 grams coriander seeds, whole; 
6 grams angelica root, coarsely ground;
0.60 grams orris root, coarsely ground;
8 grams ground almonds;
4 gram dried lemon peel;
6 grams liquorice root, coarsely ground;
6 grams cassia bark, coarsely ground;
6 grams cubeb pepper berries, whole;
6 grams grains of paradise, whole;
8 grams fresh lemon zest.\\
\\
\textsc{Liqueur}
600 ml muscidine syrup;
1000 ml 75\% ABV gin concentrate;
1165 ml 8\% ABV unsweetened home-made muscadine wine, filtered with paper coffee filter;
435 ml 95\% ABV neural spirits.
}

\textsc{The unsweetened muscadine wine used in this recipe is easiest to obtained by making your own. The wine used here was made using red muscadines and no additional sugar hence the low 8\% ABV. The volume of syrup, wine, and neutral spirits given assume  8\% ABV  dry wine and a yield of 3.2 liters of 40\% ABV liqueur.}

\textsc{Most commercially available muscadine wine has residual sugar and is described on it's label as sweet or semi-sweet.  In addition, commercially available wine has a higher ABV than the wine used here. Commercially made muscadine wine can be used for this recipe, however, adjustments must be made to account for both the extra sugar and the extra alcohol in the wine.}

Begin by making the muscidine syrup. In a stainless steel sauce pan combine the muscidine hulls and the water and simmer for 5 minutes or so.  While the muscidine water is still warm filter it first through a fine metal strainer to remove most of the hulls and then through a paper coffee filter to remove the fine particles. Clean the sauce pan then add the sugar and filtered muscidine water to it. Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Reserve until needed to sweeten and proof down the liqueur. 

Using the instructions for making \hyperref[ConcentrationMethod]{four bottles of gin in one run using an Air Still} make 1000 ml of gin concentrate.  Combine 600 ml of the muscidine syrup,
the  75\% ABV gin concentrate, the muscadine wine, and the 95\% ABV neural spirits in a one gallon glass jug. Shake well to combine then wait for week for the liqueur to settle and for any sediment to form and drop out of solution. If required, filter to remove any sediment that has formed and then bottle.

The recipe above uses 600 ml of syrup for 1000 ml of gin concentrate. This ratio works well if the wine contains no additional sugar. If using sweetened wine then the amount of syrup should be reduced to account for the sugar in the wine.  Until you have some experience with the wine you are using you will have to guess at the amount of syrup to use. For wine labeled as sweet 400 ml of syrup for 1000 ml of gin concentrate is likely a good starting place. For wine labeled as semi-sweet try 500 ml of syrup for 1000 ml of gin concentrate. With the 1000 ml of gin concentrate at a known \%ABV and the chosen amount of syrup, the volume of wine at it's known \%ABV can be determine using the following equation:

$$V_W = \frac{V_L(P_N-P_L) - V_C(P_N-P_C) - V_S P_N}{P_N - P_W}.$$

The volume of neural spirits to add can then be determined using

$$V_N=V_L-V_C-V_S-V_W .$$

The symbols in these equations are defined as follows: 

$V_L$ -- volume of liqueur

$P_L$  --  \%ABV of liqueur

$V_C$  -- volume of gin concentrate

$P_C$  --  \%ABV  of gin concentrate

$V_W$ --  volume of wine

$P_W$  --  \%ABV  of wine

$V_N$ -- volume of neural spirits

$P_N$ --  \%ABV  of neural spirits

$V_S$ -- volume of syrup

\recipe{Developing A New Gin Recipe}

Instructions for making 750 ml of gin is a small pot still.

To develop a new gin recipe first pick the botanicals you will use.  Use 3 botanicals from the essential category in Table \ref{tab:essential}: juniper berries, coriander seeds, and either orris root or angelica root as a fixative (or use both).  From 5 to 7 of the other the other categories chose one botanical. This results in 8 to 10 total botanicals. 

Do not crush any of the ingredients. When removing the zest from fresh citrus be careful not to remove any white pith along with the zest. Add all ingredients except the flower petals, fresh herbs and fresh citrus zest to the still.  Zest orange and add orange zest strips and rose petals wrapped in cheese cloth to the gin basket.  Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 15 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next 425 ml of distillate for use in making the gin. Dilute the collected distillate with purified water to 45 \% ABV. The result should be approximately 750 ml of gin. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize.

\recipe{Botanical Isotopes}

\textsc{An efficient method for developing and refining new gin recipes is to use botanical isotopes. A botanical isotope is just concentrated ``gin'' made with a single botanical (it is not really gin unless the single botanical is juniper berries.) Using this method, a new gin recipe is developed by combining botanical isotopes with a base gin until a pleasing combination is discovered. The base gin is typically made using the essential gin botanicals -- juniper berries and coriander seeds plus orris root and/or angelica root.} 

\textsc{To make a botanical isotope a large quantity of a single botanical is mixed with neutral spirit then the mixture is distilled and the collected distillate is proofed down to the chosen ABV of the base gin.}

\ingredients{500 ml 40\% ABV neutral spirits or 285 ml of 70\% ABV neutral spirits + 215 ml water; 15 grams gin botanical.}

If you intend to macerate the botanical in the final gin recipe then macerate the botanical in 70\% ABV neutral spirits for 24 hours. After macerating for 24 hours add 215 ml water to the neutral spirits/botanical mixture to dilute it to 40\% ABV. Add the diluted mixture to the Air Still. If you will not macerate the botanical in the final gin recipe then add 500 ml of 40\% ABV neutral spirits and the botanical directly to the Air Still. Turn on the still and collect and discard the first 12 ml of distillate to emerge.  After this collect the next 225 ml of distillate for use in making the isotope. Dilute the collected distillate with purified water to the ABV chosen for the gin recipe. This should yield around 375 ml of botanical isotope.

\recipe{Turbo Yeast}
\label{Turbo Yeast}

\ingredients{
pinch Epsom salts;
\half tablespoon diamonioum phospate (DAP);
\half teaspoon citric acid;
2 tablespoons yeast nutrient; 
1 tablespoon distiller's yeast.}

Mix all ingredients together in a small stainless steel mixing bowl and store in an airtight container.

Makes enough for a sugar wash made with 5 gallons of water and 10 pounds corn sugar.
\newpage

\recipe{Ted's Fast Fermenting Vodka}
\label{TFFV}

\ingredients{4 kilograms sugar;
250 grams wheat bran;
1 multivitamin tablet, crushed;
pinch Epsom salts;
\half teaspoon diamonioum phospate (DAP);
\half teaspoon citric acid;
50 grams bakers yeast or 25 grams distiller's yeast.}

\textsc{This recipe makes 23 liters or 6.1 gallons.}

In a large pot (6  or more quarts) bring 3 quarts of water to the boil. Add the 250 g of bran, stir, bring back to the boil then simmer for 30 minutes stirring from time to time. When cooked the bran and water becomes a thin porridge.

Dissolve the sugar in warm water and add to the fermenter with cool water to bring quantity up to 20 litres. Add the crushed multivitamin tablet, Epsom salts and diamonioum phospate.

Once the bran has simmered for 30 minutes, add it to the fermenter.

Adjust the pH to around 5 with the citric acid. This usually takes about \half teaspoon of citric acid.

Rehydrate the yeast in 100 ml water and add to the mix. Making sure the start temp is below 30\deg C = 86 \deg F.

Stir well (I use a stick blender or paint mixer and drill to thoroughly aerate it.)

Leave plenty of headroom as this takes off like a rocket. I use a 30 liter fermenter.
Do NOT seal the fermenter for at least 24 hours as a thick foamy cap will form within an hour. I put it under an airlock only after 36 hrs so I can monitor progress.

This produces a fast ferment (normally dry to .990 within 3 to 4 days). The start specific gravity is around 1.070 so the yeast is not pushed hard to produce off-flavours and the resulting wash is approximately 10\% ABV.

Rack off and allow to stand for a couple of days to clear before distilling.

\recipe{Rice Wash Using Angel Yellow Label Yeast}
\label{RiceWash}

\equilpment{7 gallon brewing pail with air lock, Thermopen MK4 instant-read thermometer.}

\ingredients{9 or 10 pounds (4.1 or 4.5 kg) Goya rice flour; 
3\half or 4 gallons very-hot (around 125\deg F) tap water; 
32 or 36 grams (1.3 oz) Angel Yellow Label Yeast}

\textsc{Goya rice flour can be purchased packaged in either 5-pound or 1\half\hspace{-5pt}-pound bags. For this recipe you can use either 2 5-pound bags or 6 1\half\hspace{-5pt}-pound bags. I prefer to use 5-pound bags, however, the cost per pound of Goya rice flour is often significantly lower when buying 1\half\hspace{-5pt}-pound bags in bulk.}

Add the rice flour to the brewing pail then add the hot water one gallon at a time stirring well after each addition.  Loosely attach the pail's cover then let the wash cool naturally to about 90\deg F (32 \deg C), agitating occasionally to prevent settling. Note that it takes around 7 hours for the wash to cool from 125\deg F to 90\deg F with the brewing pail in a room at cool room temperature. When the wash is 90\deg F add the yeast directly to the wash and stir vigorously. Attach the pail top and the fill air lock.

During fermentation control the wash temperature to be 82-97\deg F (28-36\deg C). The optimal fermentation temperature is about 90\deg F (32\deg C).
The fermentation temperature lower limit is 79\deg F (26\deg C) and the upper limit 100\deg F (38\deg C). Agitate the wash twice every day for the first three days of fermentation. At 90\deg F the wash should ferment to dry in around three or four days. After fermentation is complete give the wash a vigorous stir and then let it settle for several days before siphoning off the clear wash into the still boiler. The fermented wash should yield around 10\% ABV.

\recipe{Corn Wash Using High Temperature Alpha-Amylase}

\equilpment{Still Spirits Turbo 500 Boiler; PID temperature controller with thermocouple; AC power drill with steel paint mixer; improvised stand to hold drill and thermocouple; 7 gallon brewing pail with air lock; triplescale brewing hydrometer; Thermopen MK4 instant-read thermometer; pH meter.}

\ingredients{7.5 pounds ground dried corn kernels or ground corn meal; 
5.75 gallon cold tap water;
3.75 grams SEBstar HTL (liquid high temperature Alpha-Amylase);
3.75 grams SEBamyl GL (liquid GlucoAmylase);
2 tablespoons distiller's yeast (Red Star DADY);
citric acid and/or sodium carbonate as needed to adjust pH;
iodine for starch test.}



Add cold water to the boiler then position stirrer and thermocouple. Turn on boiler and set the PID controller to 185\deg F. With the stirrer running on its highest speed, slowly add the corn meal to the water. Measure the pH and then adjust the pH to between 5.6 and 6.5 (lower end recommended). After the pH is adjusted add SEBstar HTL to the wash. Monitor the temperature and when it hits 185\deg F start a timer. The stirrer speed can now be reduced to medium to reduce the sound level.  After 1 hour at 185\deg F do an iodine starch test.  If all the starch has converted then proceed to the next steps, otherwise hold the wash at 185\deg F for an additional 30 minutes and then do another iodine starch test.


When all the starch in the corn meal is converted dextrins, set the PID controller to 140\deg F and wait for the wash to cool to that temperature.  Turning the stirrer to its highest speed will aid in cooling. While the wash is cooling adjust the pH to between 2.8 and 5.5 (upper end recommended).  When the wash is 140\deg F add the SEBamyl GL.  Hold the wash at 140\deg F for 1 hour then test the specific gravity using a hydrometer. The specific gravity should be around 1.060 giving a potential ABV or around 8\%.

Turn off the boiler and allow the wash to cool to the pitching temperature for the yeast (100\deg F to 90\deg F). You can let the wash cool naturally or use ice in zipper lock bags to speed the cooling.

Once the temperature drops to below 100\deg F transfer the wash to the brewing pail. Check the pH again and adjust to around 5 if necessary. Add the yeast directly to the wash and stir vigorously. Attach the pail top and the fill air lock.

During fermentation control the wash temperature to be around 86\deg F.

Note: Five gallons of wash were obtained by letting the wash settle for a few weeks after fermentation ended and then pumping off the clear portion.  The remaining portion was placed in a brew bag placed in a colander and allowed to drain.  Finally the brew bag was squeezed to extract as much wash as possible.  This wash was placed in the T500 with the alembic pot still head for the stripping run. The stripping run ended at 5\% ABV and yielded around 3.5 liters of maybe 30\% ABV low wines.  The low wines were put in the AirStill for the spirit run.  The first 200 ml was discarded and then 200-300ml portions were collected.  Hard cuts were made to remove the heads. The tails tasted much of corn and all but the last portion of tails was included in the spirits.  The run resulted in 1000ml of spirits at 70.5\% ABV and 800ml of feints.


\newpage
\recipe{Ben's Panela Rum Wash}

\ingredients{25 kg Panela; 100 liters water; Fleischmann's bread yeast; A touch of yeast nutrient or some boiled baker's yeast.}
\ingredients{10-12 pounds Panela; 5 gallons water; 1\half teaspoons Fermaid O yeast nutrient; \half teaspoon glucoamylase; around 1 teaspoon citric acid; 20 grams Still Spirits Rum yeast or 40 grams bread yeast. }

Chop panela into small pieces and combine with around 3 gallons of near boiling water in fermenter. Add yeast nutrient to the fermenter. Stir until the panela is completely dissolved and then add 2 gallons of cold water.  Add glucoamylase then stir to incorporate. Test the PH and adjust to around 5.2 with citric acid.  Measure and record the specific gravity of the wash. When the temperature drops to below 90\deg F add yeast and stir vigorously. During fermentation hold the temperature of the wash between 85\deg F and 90\deg F.

Use double distillation with a stripping run and a spirit run. To get more flavor in the spirit run, reserve 10\% to 20\% of the wash before the stripping run and mix it with the low wines from the stripping run for the spirit run. Let the mixture rest for a week or so before making the spirit run. If you have them then add your rum feints to the still before the spirit run.

Age the white spirit in a light toast, char 2 new American white oak barrel or using a toasted and charred American oak stave in a glass jar.


\newpage

\recipe{Oak-Aged Rice Spirits}

\ingredients{1 liter \hyperref[RiceWash]{rice spirits} at 55\% to 60\% ABV; 
6-inch long stave of medium-toasted and charred American white-oak;
1 or 2 one-inch cubes cut from a used bourbon barrel head (optional).}

Combine all ingredients in a large glass jar with a tightly fitting lid. Place jar in an out-of-the-way location, preferably in a storage room or shed where the temperature cycles from day to night.

Start checking the spirits for taste, smell and color after a three months of so of aging and then every month thereafter. The raw spirit taste and smell should be replaced by the smell and taste of whiskey.  Also, the spirit should turn a dark golden brown so that it is will be the color of commercial whiskey after it is proofed down to 45\% ABV and transferred to a 750 ml bottles. This transformation should take around 6 months.

When the spirits are ready, carefully pour off of the wood into a very fine-mesh stainless steel conical-strainer and collect the strained spirits. Over the course of a few days, proof the strained spirits down to 45\% ABV by adding purified water in timed increments. When diluting the spirits be sure that the spirits and the water are at the same temperature. Adding the water in increments and having the spirit and water at the same temperature reduces the chance that the proteins in the spirit will come out of solution, flocculate, and cloud your spirit. If your spirit does flocculate you will observe a white cloud usually at the bottom of your bottle after it rests for a few days on the shelf. The protein cloud does no harm but is unattractive and so should be avoided if possible. 

One sure way to avoid the problem of flocculation is to age your spirit at the \%ABV you wish to drink it at, say 50\% ABV.  For corn and barley spirits this is usually what I do, however, I find that rice based spirits benefits from aging on wood at a higher ABV. 



\newpage
\recipe{Bearded's Invert Sugar Vodka Wash} 

\ingredients{20 pounds (9 kg) white sugar;
5 teaspoons citric acid;
5 teaspoons + 5 teaspoons  yeast nutrient (Fermaid O);
\quarter teaspoon Epsom salt;
5 tablespoons distiller's yeast (Red Star DADY);
sodium carbonate as needed.}

Mix 3 gallons of water with sugar and citric acid. Stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil and then boil for 20 minutes. Turn off fire and cool for 1 hour. Combine invert sugar syrup with 9 gallons of water. Add 5 teaspoons of yeast nutrient and Epson salt and stir.  Add distillers yeast and stir.  Check pH and adjust to between 4.4 and 5.4.  To raise pH add 1 tablespoon of sodium carbonate. Measure SP and record. The SP should be close to 1.092 (12.08 potential ABV). When SP drops by 30 percent add the second 5 teaspoons of the yeast nutrient. 

If using a pot still, distilling the 12 gallons of wash in striping runs should result in 3 gallons of 40\% ABV low wines.  For a spirits run in a pot or column still, add sodium carbonate (washing soda) at a rate of 1 teaspoon per liter of low wines to increase the amount of hearts in the run.  If needed, add a few liters of water to the low wines to help it distill.  Make a slow spirits run with hard cuts to yield a very clean flavored spirit.  The spirits run should result in 1 gallon of hearts at 75 ABV from a regular pot still or 3 liters of 95 ABV from a column still.  For the cleanest results filter diluted spirits with a carbon filter.

\textsc{Distilling 5 bottles of commercially available 12\% ABV muscadine wine will yield approximately 1 bottle of 40\% ABV eau de vie. Most muscadine wine made to be consumed as wine is made with sugar added to the juice to boost the final ABV and also sweetened with sugar after fermentation. Wine of this sort is fine for making eau de vie, however, if you are making wine to be distilled rather that drunk as wine then there is no need to add sugar. Wine made from muscadine juice alone will be around 8 \% ABV so 2 gallons of wine will be required to make one bottle of eau de vie.}

Add baking soda to aluminum casserole dish and then add near boiling water.  Stir until baking soda is dissolved and then add silver pieces. Wearing rubber gloves, scrub silver pieces with aluminum foil as necessary then rinse and dry.  Add additional silver pieces to dish and repeat steps. This process is less effective as the solution cools. If you will be cleaning a large number of pieces then you can put the aluminum casserole dish in a cast iron casserole dish placed on a cook top to maintain a solution temperature just under boiling. Discard the aluminum casserole dish when finished.

\recipe{Cleaning Solution for Copper}
\label{CleaningSolution}

\ingredients{500 ml water;
50 ml 3\% Hydrogen Peroxide Solution;
1\half tablespoons Citric Acid.}

Mix all ingredients by shaking in a closed bottle with a top and then allow to settle and clear before using. To clean copper place the copper item in the solution for around 20 minutes.  After removing the copper item from the cleaning solution, clean with water and dish soap and then rinse with water to remove all dish soap.

\recipe{Cleaning Coffee Maker}

\ingredients{10 grams of either baking soda or sodium carbonate.}

If using baking soda first convert it to sodium carbonate by baking it in a 200\deg F oven for one hour.  Mix the sodium carbonate with 1 liter of water and pour into coffee maker's reservoir. Turn on the machine and complete the brew cycle.  After the cycle is complete, rinse all machine components that come into contact with the solution and then repeat the brew cycle twice with clean water.

\recipe{Season a Cast Iron Pan}

\ingredients{Unseasoned or stripped cast iron pan; flaxseed oil.}

If the pan has been previously seasoned then strip it of seasoning by running it through the self-cleaning cycle of a self-cleaning oven. 

To begin seasoning, warm the unseasoned pan for 15 minutes in a 200\deg F oven. 

Remove the pan from the oven.  Place 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil in the pan and, using tongs, rub the oil into the surface with paper towels. With fresh paper towels, thoroughly wipe out the pan to remove the excess oil. 

Place the oiled pan upside down in a cold oven, then set the oven to its maximum baking temperature. Once the oven reaches its maximum temperature, heat the pan for one hour.  Turn off the oven and cool the pan in the oven for at least two hours.

\recipe{Bubble Stuff for Giant Bubbles}

\ingredients{1 cup Joy or Dawn dishwashing liquid;
4 tablespoons glycerine (available at most drugstores);
10 to 15 cups cold water.}

Add 10 cups of water to a large pail and then pour in dishwashing liquid.  Add glycerine and then stir gently to avoid creating froth on top of the solution.  When solution is completely mixed, skim off any froth with your hand. On very dry days it may be necessary to add up to 5 cups of additional water to make truly huge bubbles.

\recipe{Simple Sugar Wash for Distilling}
\label{SimpleWash}
\equilpment{9.5 liter stainless steel stock pot; long handled stainless steel spoon; 12 liter (3 gallon) plastic fermenter with lid and airlock; triple-scale hydrometer; Thermapen digital thermometer; 2 liter (8 cup) Pyrex measuring cup; no-wash sanitizing product.}

\ingredients{1.75 kg sugar;
1.5 g citric acid;
1.8 g diamonioum phospate (DAP);
1.3 g food-grade gypsum (calcium sulphate);
150 mg Epsom salts;
16.8 g of distillers yeast or \quarter cup of dried bakers yeast.
}

\textsc{I found this recipe on the Home Distillers Forums under the name ``Wineos Plain Ol Sugar Wash.'' I have scaled the original recipe so that it works in a 12 liter (3 gallon) fermenter.  The target amount of sugar wash is 10.25 liters.  This volume should yield 8 liters of clear wash for distilling.} 

Mark 10.25 liters on the outside of your fermenter. Sanitize your fermenter and top, airlock, stock pot, hydrometer, thermometer probe, measuring cup and spoon before beginning.

In a stainless steel stock pot, bring around  4 liters of water to a simmer then dissolve the sugar in the hot water.  Mix well with a stainless or plastic spoon until the sugar is completely dissolved. In a drinking glass, add hot water and citric acid. Stir the solution until the citric acid is completely dissolved and then add to the sugar solution. Repeat this procedure with the diamonioum phospate, gypsum, and Epsom salts, individually. Stir the sugar solution until all the additions are incorporated.

Add the hot water solution to fermenter. Add cool water (and ice if you are in a hurry -- the ice should all melt) to make the total volume close to but under 10 liters. Using a hydrometer test the specific gravity (be sure to correct for the temperature of the solution). The specific gravity should be above 1.080. Add additional cold water to obtain a  specific gravity between 1.070 and 1.080. After fermentation this will yield between 9.5\% and 11\% alcohol by volume.

Check the temperature of the wash and once it is at or less than 95\deg F sprinkle the yeast on top. After 15-20 minutes, give the wash a good stir to incorporate the yeast and add some air to the wash. Place the cover on the fermenter and add water to the airlock. Place in a storage room or other similar out of the way place at warm room temperature.

Depending on the fermenting temperature this will work off in a week or two. It is important not to rush the fermentation. Let it finish fermenting to a specific gravity of 0.990 or less and then give it another week to clear before racking and running it.  It is important to rack the clear wash off the yeast sediment and only place the clear wash in the still so that a neutral and flavorless spirit is obtained.

% Citric acid 9.9g/T; Gypsum 8.7g/T; DAP 11.9g/T; Red Star distillers yeast 37.1g/\quarter cup; Epson Salts 13.7g/T

% My fermenter: Total Volume = 412 fluid oz = 3.2 gal; Volume below valve = 76 fluid ounces = 0.594 gal = 2.25 l;

% Desired amount of clear wash = 8 l. Target amount of wash to make = 10.25 l = 2.71 gal

\newpage
\recipe{Gin \#2 - In Development}

\ingredients{3\half cups 45\% ABV neutral spirits; 0.5 gram strip of blood orange zest; 15 grams juniper berries; 4 grams coriander seeds} 

Pour neutral spirits into a 1-quart Mason jar. 

Carefully remove zest from orange being certain that no white pith is included. Trim zest strip until it weighs 0.5 grams.

Using a mortar and pestle thoroughly crush the juniper berries and coriander seeds. 

Add the orange zest, juniper berries and coriander seeds to the neutral spirits, place the lid and ring on the jar, and shake.  Allow the mixture to macerate for around 7 days shaking the jar occasionally.

To distill, remove and discard orange zest then add contents of Mason jar (including juniper berries and coriander seeds) to the Air Still.  Add an additional quart of water to the still. Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 20 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next approximately 750 ml of distillate. Stop collecting distillate when the measured ABV of the collected distillate is around 45\%. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize. Some distillers suggest that aging the gin several months improves the flavor. 

\newpage

\recipe{Gin \#3 - In Development}

\ingredients{3\half cups 45\% ABV neutral spirits; 0.15 gram dried bitter orange zest; 15 grams juniper berries; 3 grams coriander seeds; 1.5 grams angelica root.} 

Pour neutral spirits into a 1-quart Mason jar. 


Using a mortar and pestle thoroughly crush the juniper berries and coriander seeds. 

Add the dried orange zest, juniper berries, coriander seeds, and angelica root to the neutral spirits, place the lid and ring on the jar, and shake.  Allow the mixture to macerate for around 7 days shaking the jar occasionally.

To distill, add contents of Mason jar plus one quart of water to the Air Still.  Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 20 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next approximately 750 ml of distillate. Stop collecting distillate when the measured ABV of the collected distillate is around 45\%. Bottle and wait at least one week before drinking to allow flavors to stabilize. Some distillers suggest that aging the gin several months improves the flavor. 

\recipe{Gin \#4 - In Development}

\ingredients{
750 ml 50\% ABV neutral spirits or vodka;
12 grams juniper berries;
3 grams coriander seeds; 
0.5 grams cardamom; 
0.75 grams angelica root;
8 grams orange zest
} 

Pour neutral spirits into a 1-quart Mason jar. 

Do not crush any of the ingredients. Add the  juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, and cardamon to the neutral spirits, place the lid and ring on the jar, and shake.  Allow the mixture to macerate over night shaking the jar occasionally.

To distill, add contents of Mason jar plus one cup of water to the Air Still. Zest orange and add orange zest strips wrapped in cheese cloth to the gin basket.  Turn on still and after around 25 minutes collect and discard the first 17 ml of distillate to emerge. After this collect the next 375 ml of distillate for use in making the gin. Dilute the collected distillate with purified water to 44 \% ABV.

With this amount of orange zest your gin may louch. To correct louching, add 44 \% ABV neurtal spirits to your gin until it is clear.

Comment: For this recipe I used purchased 50 \% ABV vodka. The recipe yielded excellent if very orange forward gin after it was diluted to correct louching. The juniper flavor was not as harsh as previous recipes and I believe that is because the berries were not crushed.

recipe{Rice Wash}

\ingredients{6 to 12 kg (13 to 26 lb) of rice (I used 6 kg of medium grain rice); 
Water; 
36 grams (1.3 oz) Angel Yellow Label Yeast}

Using a grain mill or food processor, mill the rice to small pieces. If using a food processor, process in 1 kg batches for 5 minutes per batch (let the processor cool between processing batches). Measure the volume of the milled rice then put rice in brewing pail. Add a volume of almost boiling water equal to around three times the volume of the milled rice to the pail. Using a paint mixer and drill, agitate the mixture in the pail very well. 

Let the mixture sit for 1 hour then
add cold and/or warm water as needed to reach a total volume of 55 liters (14 gal) at 30\deg C (86\deg F).
Hydrate the yeast in 35\deg C (95\deg F) water. 
Add the hydrated yeast to the rice wash and agitate using a paint mixer.
Ferment at 30\deg C (86\deg F).
Wait for 3 days after fermentation has stopped then rack into still. 
Run three stripping runs of around 4 gallons.
Slowly distill the low wines from the three stripping runs in one spirit run 
making cuts based on flavor. 

Dunder and Lightning uses 6kg medium grain rice plus 20 liters of boiling water and 20 liters of cold water and 36 grams of yeast. He stirs every day for the first three days and then ferments to dry in 2 weeks. His yield was 1.4 liters of 94\% ABV. 


Instructions from Angel Yellow Label Yeast: For 100 kg of grain.
The finer the grind, the sooner it finishes.
Mix 100 kg with 250-300 kg of hot water.
Let cool naturally to about 90\deg F (32 \deg C), agitating to prevent settling.
Directly add 0.5-0.8 kg of the starter. Agitate.
Control the temperature to be 82-97\deg F (28-36\deg C), optimal fermentation temperature about 90\deg F (32\deg C).
Lower limit 79\deg F (26\deg C), upper limit 100\deg F (38\deg C).
Agitate twice every day in the first three days.
Ferment for 8-15 days.

According to the Angle Yellow Label Yeast instruction 6 kg (13.2 pounds) of rice would call for 18 liters (4.76 gallons) of water.  This is much less water than used in the recipes above. The 36 grams of yeast corresponds to 600 grams of yeast for 100 kg of rice. This is within the range recommended by the instructions.

\recipe{Gin Extract}
\label{GinExtract}

\ingredients{35 grams whole juniper berries;
2 grams whole coriander seeds;
2 grams green cardamom pods;
2 grams orris root;
400 ml water;
75 ml 95\% ABV neutral spirits.
}

Using an electric spice grinder, individually grind each botanical and add it to the still.  Add water to the still and then run still collecting the first 75 ml to emerge.
Add 75 ml neutral spirits to the 75 ml collected from the still and bottle.

To make gin using the gin extract, add 1 ml of extract to every 100 ml of 45\% ABV neutral spirits used.

This recipe is from the Barley and Hops YouTube channel.  The botanical amounts are roughly the same as the amounts used with 1 liter of 40\% ABV neutral spirits for recipes to be made in an Air-Still.  This suggests that any of the recipes in this chapter could be used to make Gin Extract using the method described in this recipe.
\recipe{Corn Wash -- In Development}

\ingredients{3 pounds (2 1.5-pound bags) Goya fine corn meal; 
11 quarts tap water;
\half teaspoon Amylase enzyme;
\quarter teaspoon Glucoamylase;
15 grams distiller's yeast.}

AMYLASE ENZYME BSG -- Amylase is easy to use.  When you have finished cooking your mash, allow it to cool to below 170 degrees and stir in one teaspoon (0.1 to 0.3 teaspoons per gallon) amylase per 5 gallons.  Amylase is a self-limiting glucoside there is nothing to be gained by upping the dosage.  Allow the mash to cool for an hour, but keep the temperature above 120 and stir occasionally.  Alternately if you are set up to hold the mash at 152 degrees for one hour that is ideal for highest conversion rates. 

Glucoamylase (10g) -- Sufficient for up to 20 pounds of dextrins (\half teaspoon per 5 gallons). For optimal activity add sachet contents to wash or wort once cooled to 131-140\deg F
(55-60\deg C). Stir to dissolve thoroughly. Pitch yeast once temperature is below 86\deg F
(30\deg C) and leave to ferment.
Enzyme is stable up to 149\deg F(65\deg C).
Optimum pH is pH 4.0 to 4.5 (enzyme is stable between pH 2.8 and pH 5.0).
Note: all enzymes require 50ppm calcium ions for maximum activity and stability.

Add water to a 5 gallon stock pot and place over high heat.  While the water is heating adjust its pH to 4.6. When the water reaches 180\deg F add the corn flour to the hot water in a slow stream using an immersion blender to fully incorporate the flour. Return temperature to 180\deg F and cook for 30 minutes stirring regularly to avoid scorching the corn meal. Add a little amylase enzyme to loosen the wash if it is too thick to stir effectively. Turn off the heat and cool the wash to 155\deg F.  You can let the wash cool naturally or use ice in zipper lock bags to speed the cooling. When the wash is 155\deg F add the amylase enzyme and stir well. Cover the pot and insulate with an old blanket to maintain the temperature and give around 90 minutes for the starch conversion to take place.

After 90 minutes do a starch test with iodine to be sure the starch has converted to sugar. Take a gravity reading to determine the potential alcohol.  Let the wash cool to 140\deg F and then add the glucoamylase and stir well.  Once the temperature drops to below 86\deg F transfer the wash to the brewing pail. Check the pH again and adjust to around 5 if necessary. Add the yeast directly to the wash and stir vigorously. Attach the pail top and the fill air lock.

During fermentation control the wash temperature to be around 86\deg F.
